review/summary: Delicious cookie mix
review/text: I thought it was funny that I bought this product without knowing it was a mix. I read the header very quickly and just thought it was packaged cookies. But no, it is cookie MIX and I guess I should have noticed that since it is right in the title.This is the first time I have ever tried baking with a cookie mix. If you are used to the convenience of the cookie dough that you buy wrapped up in plastic logs then you might be in for a bit of a surprise. Mixing up the dough can get VERY messy (it is extremely sticky). However, with a cookie mix like this you have a lot of flexibility in the ratio of ingredients (I like to add some extra butter to make the baked cookies more chewy). Also, this mix has really large chocolate chips in it--I love that.I removed a star for the addition of 'natural flavors' in the mix.

review/text: This cereal is so sweet....yet so good for you! One taste=ADDICTION!!!! I just tried this cereal out of curiousity and I was hooked! It is an excellent breakfast choice, or just any time to eat! Especially as breakfast because you will crave more honey taste and you won't be hungry later {probably because of how much you'd eat} and it is actually sweeter and better than Honey Bunches of Oats. Cap'n Crunch Berries is an option, but this splendid cereal is SO FILLED WITH A HONEY-FILLED TASTE! I have not tried much better tasting cereal than this! Oh!

review/text: Man I love Oh's cereal. It is really great to the last bite, but the size of the box its so small compared to all the other cereals out there. The price is crazy for such a small box...but oh's is one of the best cereals I have ever ever eaten. It keeps me coming back despite the small box, and crazy price. If you never had it you should try it just once. It is wonderful I give it 3 stars only because of the price and how much food you get. If the portions were more fair even for this price it would be five star gold...

review/text: Oh yes. This cereal is delicious. It's O-shaped corn pieces with "good things in the middle", like real oatmeal. This is a Quaker product, after all. The caramel-like taste, which I'd compare to Cap'n Crunch or old school Mr T, Gremlins and Batman cereal, is sweetened with honey, graham (cracker) flour and brown sugar.It's not a good-tasting but a great-tasting cereal, easily one of the best I've ever tried. But; get this; it's too crunchy. No, it wont get soggy in milk, at-least not in any reasonable amount of time, but that's the problem because it makes for a hard chew. If it had the texture and consistency of, say, Cheerios, it'd be perfect.marcellee.com

But then I tried it again this week and the aftertaste was so strong. The overall texture and layout of each piece is like Fruit Loops but with tons of honey add and less fruit or frosting. One box should be more than enough.

review/text: The 5 stars is based on 1)the taste which is amazing and 2) the price which is $1.99.HOWEVER there is much to dislike in OH's. They are NOT healthy, in fact they are the only cereal I've seen made with hydrogenated vegetable oil which is basically margarine. The lard will coat your spoon and roof of your mouth and probably arteries with a white oily film that does not rinse off with water alone. It must be diluted in soap and scrubbed.It is captain crunch shaped in a ring with bits in the middle and somehow sweeter and rougher on your mouth. Oh's virgins WILL have bloody pallates if not careful.

review/text: The Lurpak Danish butter holds its own in comparison with the most expensive French butter. I actually prefer Lurpak over expensive brands like Beurre d'Echire, Celes-sur-Belle, or Isigny-Ste-Mere.Lurpak is a true lactic, or cultured, butter, and it is full of flavor. Therefore a warning is in order: once you start using this stuff there is no going back. Land O'Lakes simply will not do anymore and you will be stuck searching for this stuff wherever you go from then on.

review/text: I guess with any cheese or dairy product, different people are going to have different tastes. This butter is slightly closer to tasting like cheese (although it does not taste like cheese) than kellygold butter, imo. Maybe that's why I like kellygold better. Because I don't like the taste of cheese.I'm sort of glad I got this butter to at least compare with kellygold though. I think it is more easily spreadable, and maybe a tad bit "softer" butter than kellygold.Maybe I'll just try ordinary organic american made butter next time.. it's a whole lot cheaper, and see how it compares with premium butters.

review/summary: you're cooking with Butter
review/text: Recently (I think it was their cookie show) ATK voted Lurpak as the #1 butter in their tasting. And unlike Rach Ray who doesn't think twice about recommending the most ludicrous ingredients that cost the most, I have tremendous respect for Chris Kimball because he actually knows what he's talking about.The taste of Lurpak is very similar to Land O' Lakes, which IMO is truly the standard of butter. I have only tried it a few times since I do not have any recipes that call for butter, but I wanted to try Lurpak since it was so highly recommended. On a piece of toast it is fine and it melts very well.It comes in a little block and it is extremely firm (the sign of all fine butter).I am not certain if I will purchase this again since I was not overly impressed with Lurpak and because Land O' Lakes comes packaged much nicer and is a lot less. Nevertheless, Lurpak is still a good butter to try and to use if you have any recipes that call for a high-fat content butter.Anyway I found this at Shop Rite (don't you dare buy this online unless you enjoy paying more than twice the price - it is stold at all grocery stores) for two ninety-nine for 8 ounces (which is the size of 2 Land O' Lakes sticks).Remember, you don't have to spend a lot to be a great cook.

review/summary: Real cultured butter of high quality
review/text: I usually buy the salted version of this butter since I mostly use it for spreading and for that I like the flavor of the salted version better. That being said, there are a number of recipies that call for unsalted butter and then the unsalted Lurpak is as good as you will find.Note that Lurpak is cultured butter (not sweet cream butter like most American brands) and as such it has a deep and rich flavor that no simple sweet cream butter can match. Cultured butter of this kind is produced by fermenting the cream with lactic bacteria that convert sugars to lactic acid before churning the cream into butter.In my opinion, the Lurpak Danish butter holds its own in comparison with far more expensive butters. I actually prefer Lurpak over brands like Echire, etc.

review/summary: My former #1 butter...........
review/text: ....to be replaced by Plugra.I became a 'butterholic' after tasting free sample of Lurpak at room temp spread on crakers at Wild Oats years ago.I had thought that butter was butter, and this premium stuff was just marketing gimmick, NOT!Ever since lurpak became my regular butter, I started 'testing' other premium butters, so far none ever surpassed lurpak till I tried Plugra at Whole Foods.Lurpak has this smooth, but tangy taste I crave for. It's an excellent butter to use on fancy Eurostyle bread with organic milk on mornings. But it's not a 'cooking' butter, yes one can use lurpak for cooking, but it's really a waste of flavor and such premium price to boot.Eventually I found another premium butter that replaced lurpak, Plugra, made in USA, and cheaper than lurpak, and even more complex and nuanced flavor than lurpak.Even Cook's illustrated declared Plugra a superior butter than lurpak, its former favorite just like it used to be mine.

It also makes a fantastic trail mix with almonds and dried cranberries or other dried fruit. It reminds me a little of Chex cereal or Life cereal, but it is much healthier and substantial. I have not found any cereal I like better. Now my kids love it, too. I can't keep enough of it in the house. And I prefer this cereal to Quaker Oats Squares, which are made of larger squares.

review/text: So disappointed with this product. Bought it online because I thought it would taste high end homemade. It is going out to the troops in Afghanistan and I wanted them to have a taste of home for the holidays . Unfortunately, I found I could've saved money and just bought Crunch N' Munch. This product has a bunch of un-popped kernels per bag; not randomly (which would also be bad) but at least 3 to 4 kernels per bag. I thought they would put their product through more rigorous standards of quality, but i see that is not a concern with this vendor.

review/summary: Worth Buying
review/text: Last time, my first experience with Lacas, I bought their Kenya. This time I tried their Columbian.This is a quality product for a fair price. Buying a five pound bag is a convenience, too. I only buy two of these in a year, and I never run out. Why make 50 trips a year to the grocery store to buy the teensy bag? The product arrives promptly and keeps very well. Hard to go wrong.

review/text: If you are looking for a flavorful substitute for mozzarella this is it. It has a bit of a bite, melts great and adds bunches of flavor in any application. I have sliced it and melted it on grilled chicken sandwiches, have shredded it and blended it with mozzarella and provolone for pizza, and used it in omelets - all with great results. This is a great tasting cheese - not very well known - which once you try you will be a fan of forever!

review/summary: Zsweet
review/text: This sweetener does not seem very sweet to me, but my husband will use it and he won't touch the blue, pink or yellow artificial sweeteners. I've used it in coffee and tea and baking and had pretty good results. I've mixed it with stevia as well. I don't detect any bitterness or soapiness, but it has a somewhat minty effect that is hard to describe. The mintiness is not really a flavor so much as a minty coolness. I find the yellow sweetener's flavor to be much more sugary than zsweet, but I wanted a sweetener that does not use maltodextrin as a filler.

review/text: As a natural sweetener, this is far superior to Stevia. There's no bitter aftertaste, and when I use it in coffee and tea, it tastes like sugar. HOWEVER, I've baked with it and unlike its claims, it does cause "gastrointestinal distress" for me. Stick to using it in your drinks.Note: ZSweet also sells individual packets that are supposed to have a more intense sweetness. Don't get them. They don't taste like sugar.

review/summary: I will stick with the pink or blue packets...
review/text: Found this on sale and excitedly tried it this morning in my coffee and a fresh fruit and yogurt smoothie. I wasn't pleased with results in the smoothie because it didn't seem to dissolve properly, probably because of the cold. This resulted in my smoothie having a "sandy grit" texture but the taste was okay. It did dissolve properly in the hot coffee and tasted just fine.Maybe an hour or so later my tummy started gurgling and shortly after was my first of MANY mad dashes to the bathroom today. This started with the smoothie at about 8 AM and has continued throughout the day (it is now 4:15 PM). The info about the product states that it does not cause gastrointestinal distress but other reviews support my experience that it certainly does too AND it continues for long after the product has surely been flushed (pun intended) from your body.

review/text: This is a good high fiber breakfast cereal with a high protein content. It does contain some sodium, but has a good potassium/sodium ratio. It has some sugar content (evaporated cane juice) and a good flavor. It generally is found in health food sections of larger supermarkets or in health food stores, and is now available on the Internet. My main complaint is that retailers do not generally carry the hot cereal equivalent (which I managed to get my friend Lisa to carry in her health food store).

Although you have to be careful not to buy an immature cheese - I bought this same wheel once from one of the discount warehouses, and the cheese was much too young, and lacked character - so it is back to speciality cheese shops - or Amazon now for my purchases.The price is very reasonable, since you could spend five dollars on a small wedge of Saga at a typical cheese shop.Try Saga with a slice of ripe pear!

White pepper is black pepper which has been soaked to remove the outer husk. Tellicherry peppercorns are the largest black peppercorns.Tellicherry peppercorns are superior to regular store bought peppercorns. Peppercorns are believed to be indigenous to the Malabar Coast of India. They are spicier, enhance the flavor of all your recipes and can take things up a notch. Of course, there are still recipes where you don't want the intensity of Tellicherry peppercorns, but after you taste the freshly ground flavor, it is difficult to go back to using anything else.I find myself grinding the peppercorns over scrambled eggs, mixing it into cheese fillings and flavored butters, mixing it into fillings for Samosas, using it to flavor shrimp dishes, sprinkling it liberally over salads and pasta and using it in nearly every soup recipe. Don't even get me started telling you how good Tellicherry peppercorns are with potatoes, salmon, beef tenderloin and tequila-lime chicken. Yes, I'm in love with the flavor.Make the change and you will never be able to go back to regular ground pepper. You may laugh, but there are some of us who fear the thought of regular pepper. Some have even gone to the extreme of carrying their own "Minimill Peppercorn Grinder." This is a three-inch tall mini-mill from Spices, etc that you can carry with you in a small velvet bag. Yes, I plan to buy one ASAP.Fun Fact: Pink peppercorns are not from the Piper Nigrum vine. They are the dried berries of Baies rose plant grown on the French island of R&egrave;union and make a colorful addition to sauces.If you need a recipe for Tellicherry Peppercorn Steak, just e-mail me from my site.I was first introduced to this peppercorn by a wonderful store called: Zingermans. They also have incredible olive oils and cheese.~The Rebecca Review

Some have even gone to the extreme of carrying their own "Minimill Peppercorn Grinder." This is a three-inch tall mini-mill from Spices, etc that you can carry with you in a small velvet bag. Yes, I plan to buy one ASAP.Fun Fact: Pink peppercorns are not from the Piper Nigrum vine. They are the dried berries of Baies rose plant grown on the French island of R&egrave;union and make a colorful addition to sauces.If you need a recipe for Tellicherry Peppercorn Steak, just e-mail me from my site.I was first introduced to this peppercorn by a wonderful store called: Zingermans.

review/text: 'Blue Castello, from Tholstrup (maker of fine cheeses since 1893) is a triple-cream, blue-veined cheese with a washed-rind. The surface has a unique combination of blue-green and reddish molds. These molds give Blue Castello its distinct aroma and flavor. It has a delectably rich and buttery taste accented by its tangy blue veins. The mild flavor develops steadily as long as it keeps, but it never becomes strong.'A step up from Saga blue, you are certian to enjoy this cheese!

review/text: This award winning cheese really takes the cake. Castello has never once let me down! Their danish blue is amazing in every recipe that you can add blue cheese to. I've always received nothing but fresh, quality cheese from castello products at my grocery store. It has stayed in my fridge for almost two weeks once, and was still just as good as the day i bought it. Try this spread on crackers with whatever meat you like most, and you will be in heaven. I've found it's also great if you put this in lasagna, not very traditional, but it is very good.

review/text: This tea set and its box are top-of-the-line. The only thing that almost brought it to four stars was that the decoration in the center of the top of the box was not oriented correctly, being turned, noticibly, to one side. I hope this is not endemic. Other than that, it is the type of tea set that is normally offered at seminars and meetings in 4-5 star hotels but a bit more decorative. I am proud to display this box and its selections of teas for my guests in my home.

review/text: This was a great present for my grandmother. She likes tea and this is not only a nice collection of teas, but a beautiful case for her to keep her favorites after she uses the stock ones. The selection duplicates itself in the different sections and does not have 12 different ones, only six, but this is fine. The case holds some very large sections and should hold any teabags unlike the solid brown one that I bought for my mother.I would recommend this product. Grandmother says that the tea is very good too.

review/text: Hand decorated? Maybe by slave labor in some 3rd world country. I should have read all the reviews more carefully. The only "exotic" thing about this purchase is probably the chemicals used in gluing the cheap paper onto the chest. There are glue splatters all over the top, and scratches on the inside. The paint on the corners looks like it was done by 3rd graders. I purchased this primarily for the chest, and could easily forgive the poor selection in flavors if the chest was worth more than $10. As it stands, I'm going to try to return this to Amazon ASAP.***Very Disappointed*** Read all the reviews before purchasing this!!

That the company pastes a label on the bottom of the chest and it is NOT easily removed. The label covers the entire bottom of the chest. It would be nice if they at least made it so you can remove it without leaving the wood looking worse for wear. I realize a label isn't a big deal; I just prefer to give a gift without the unsightly label.

review/summary: Tea Chest Review - More for the tea than the chest
review/text: This item is what it mostly says it is. Most of the tea flavors are decent (I especially like the Peach Tea, but dislike the Orange Spice Tea). Recently these Bentley Tea Chests have been on sale at Amazon for quite decent prices. Don't expect too much from the box though. It's a paper covered pine box with a couple of handles and a front catch. It does have a very thin velvet lining inside, but I wouldn't count on the inside box cells to isolate flavors or prevent oxidation, so foil or paper covered tea bags are a must for this tea chest. Overall a decent value if you buy it on a good sale.

review/text: I am an avid tea and coffee drinker and this is one of my favorites. In only 4 minutes you get a cup of black tea that is well balanced with a pronounced flavor and aroma of vanilla beans. Everytime I make it at home I feel like I am getting high end tea shop tea in my own kitchen. I love that there is enough natural sweetness (and little natural bitterness) that I can enjoy this without any milk or sweetener, unless I really want to. It is a fantastic flavor so much so that I have repeatedly bought this tea despite the price.

review/summary: Good product - Amazon Screwups
review/text: Two parts to this review - one for the product and one for Amazon1) I love this turkey pepperoni. Great taste, low calories, and little fat. It's a much healthier product than standard pepperoni. My main complaint is I have had several packages where the pepperonin are encased in mold. I couldn't see any visible holes or slits in the packaging, but the product inside was solid green and grey. This is not Amazon's fault since they just ship a box of 12 that came straight from the manufacturer with all the original labelling etc. One other time, I received only 11 of 12 packages inside the box.2) The product listing is incorrect on this page or Amazon is unable to get it right. It's listed as a pack of 12 6-ounce packages. I have ordered this product numerous times, and Amazon always ships a pack of 12 3-ounce packages. As I said above, the product is in its original packaging from the manufacturer and it clearly says in big bold letters "12 3 oz. packages" right on the box. Amazon then applies their own sticker saying "12 6 oz packages". I have ordered this product 4 different times and each time I only got half an order. To Amazon's credit, they have fixed it everytime (for me) but seem incapable of fixing the problem at the source. Either the website is listing the wrong size or someone in the warehouses can't read or do simple math. I have discussed this with customer service each time, but they still haven't fixed it.So, 4 stars for the product. 4 stars for Amazon always fixing my order in the end. 0 stars for Amazon's ability to correct a simple problem.

review/text: These have a lot of garlic and onion powder and are rather pungent. My son likes them, though! We both prefer the cheese-flavor over this one. This seems a bit overly spicy/seasoned for babies & toddlers.

review/summary: Disgusting garlic breath
review/text: First of all, I have major issues with children's snacks that are so full of sodium.I have to admit, my son loves these. What is not so great is the two or three days of garlic breath I have to endure afterwards. Was it so necessary to add garlic salt to a toddler snack? The onion and other vegetables are more than enough to provide flavour.

review/summary: Could Easily break a tooth
review/text: So disappointed with this product. Bought it online because I thought it would taste high end homemade. It is going out to the troops in Afghanistan and I wanted them to have a taste of home for the holidays . Unfortunately, I found I could've saved money and just bought Crunch N' Munch. This product has a bunch of un-popped kernels per bag; not randomly (which would also be bad) but at least 3 to 4 kernels per bag. I thought they would put their product through more rigorous standards of quality, but i see that is not a concern with this vendor.

review/summary: Pretty Good Chai Experience
review/text: ****Tazo's Chai Black Tea is an enjoyable chai experience for the most part. On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a rich blend of teas and spices in the style of the hill dwellers of the Himalayas." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Chai as "cinnamon, creamy, sweet spice" and "medium-bodied yet full-flavored, with the spicy kick of cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, and black pepper. Tazo describes the aroma as "sweet, spice". Those are pretty accurate. The black tea "blend" is a little bitter, though, even with minimal brewing. It's a real trick to get it to brew long enough to get to experience the flavor from the spices without having the tea turn bitter.The ingredients in Chai are: black teas, ginger, cinnamon, black pepper, cardamom, cloves, and star anise. It is caffeinated.Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi.Recommended.****

review/summary: NOT for introductory food
review/text: The AAP says not to make your own green beans, spinach, squash etc. due to the higher levels of nitrates so I thought this product would be great to introduce green beans to my 6 month old. The product contains FISH OIL, so it is not a suitable candidate for a 6 month old or an introductory food for any age. It is also not returnable.While the amazon site lists the product ingredients as green beans and water only, the picture of the product says with DHA. The DHA comes from fish oil. After contacting Amazon to clear up the fact that this was not the product I thought I was ordering, they refunded my money. They offered to send out a new (replacement) item, but I think I would get the same mislabeled product. While I was not happy about the trouble this mislabeling caused I think Amazon's customer service did a great job.

review/summary: Yummy in the tummy!!
review/text: These are my baby's FAVORITE foods!!! And my child is a very very very very picky eater (prefers milk over food). A little thin but perfect for 4-6 mo and for the older babies, we thicken it by adding meat or rice cereal. I was very disappointed and frustrated when all 5 of our local stores stopped carrying these. So happy I found them here for my baby! The ppl here who complain about tuna oil added are dumb (no pun intended). They help with baby brain development. It's not super easy to find the organic baby foods you want with DHA added in them (ellas kitchen, plum organic, etc don't have DHA) -- go buy those and quit whining about tuna oil added to The gerber organic green beans bc it's probably folks like you who complained to the stores that make it very difficult for many parents like me to FIND this food in stores! And if the complaining persists, gerber may stop making it all together and babies who love this product will suffer! Gerber, don't stop making these! I would give it 6 stars if I could!I bought 48 containers of gerber organic green beans from Amazon and can't wait to see the smile on her face when we eat these again (she has been w/o these for 3 mo),

review/text: I am very disappointed that Gerber has added DHA to their green beans. My son used to Love his Gerber Organic Green Beans. I (unwittingly) tried feeding him the new formulation with added DHA and he kept refusing it. I did notice that the consistency was different than usual - it had more of a gel like texture to it. And then I read the ingredients and saw that it had added Tuna Oil. !? Today I learned that another of his favorites, Gerber Organic Carrots, now has DHA added to it too. I'm so frustrated! Looks like I'll be making our own baby food now.

review/text: Okay were do I start, how about this may not be a wise source of DHA for your child. Watch a movie called Autism: Made In The USA, so you will know why. The movie is free on YouTube. This baby food product contains the FDA approved amount of mercury, which is in the tuna oil ingredient, in this baby food product. You may not be aware, BUT, mercury never leaves the body, unless you remove it by means of medical treatment removal; look that method up as well. Mercury is not good for your child, no matter the amount, I am a mother and involved in science. Take my advice and try something a lot more organic and mercury free. It will benefit you and your child in the long run.

We also had a success in making a truffle with pistachio dark chocolate ganache that everyone said hit the mark on its pistachio flavor. Next up is a warm phyllo beggars purse filled with molten chocolate ganache served in a pool of pistachio creme anglaise.

review/summary: Could Easily break a tooth
review/text: So disappointed with this product. Bought it online because I thought it would taste high end homemade. It is going out to the troops in Afghanistan and I wanted them to have a taste of home for the holidays . Unfortunately, I found I could've saved money and just bought Crunch N' Munch. This product has a bunch of un-popped kernels per bag; not randomly (which would also be bad) but at least 3 to 4 kernels per bag. I thought they would put their product through more rigorous standards of quality, but i see that is not a concern with this vendor.

review/text: I thought these would just add flavor rather than such a sweet taste. I don't like sugar in my coffee. Now I have 6 containers that I have to throw away. There used to be a product just like this that just added flavor and did not have all of the artificial sweetners. Not a good thing for someone who does not like sugar in their coffee but if you do it is good.

review/summary: Flavour Creations Hazelnut Coffee Flavoring Tablets (Pack of 6 48-count Dispensers)
review/text: I love Nescafe Tasters Choice Hazelnut-flavored instant coffee. However, the 6.1-ounce plastic container of this product is no longer available in any of my local retail stores (although a smaller package of individually portioned coffee containers is, at an exhorbitant price). Further, the best price of the Tasters Choice 6.1-ounce-package hazelnut coffee has increased from about $6.00 (store price) to nearly $57.00 (internet price, including shipping) during the past two years -- representing over a 800 percent price increase! Hence, it is no longer economically feasable for me to purchase this brand coffee. Other brands are either not acceptable for reasons of unacceptable taste or exhorbitant cost.Several years ago I tried hazelnut flavor tablets for my instant coffee and found them to be satisfactory, if not convenient (since there are two ingredients, instead of one, at each preparation).I therefore recently ordered Flavor Creations Hazelnut tablets from Amazon on a trial basis. Because I combined this order with another, Amazon charged no shipping and handling fees.The cost proved to be satisfactory, and the Flavor Creations Hazelnut tablets added to another good, but less expensive, brand of coffee made the total cost far more satisfactory. Further, the flavor was very near my original favorite.I plan to reorder these tablets when I run out, providing the cost has not increased.

review/summary: A second purchase for me
review/text: I never knew there was any flavoring like this until I saw it listed here at Amazon. I love these tablets and carry a tin with me in my purse (no larger than a tin of mints) so that I can have Hazelnut coffee when I am out. I also use these when I only want one cup of decaf coffee and make instant coffee. I like the flavor tablets because it doesn't diminish the coffee taste, dissolves easily and has very little sweetness to them. I can add Splenda easily. It is getting harder and harder to find Hazelnut coffee for a regular coffee pot or in instant form. The recommendations are for using one tablet but I always use two. If I am going to make iced coffee I have an extra large mug that I use and use three tablets instead.I was so pleased to find these on Amazon.

review/summary: Tasty and full of nutrients: great for vegans.
review/text: I eat no meat and minimal animal products which makes getting all of the needed protein and nutrients a bit difficult in some ways. Nutritional Yeast goes a long way in helping with that. It has a nice cheesy, nutty flavor which is fantastic on pasta, in soup, and lots of other foods. Adding a few tablespoons to a bowl of soup adds a nice flavor and creaminess that I love and find hard to achieve usually since I don't use milk products. On pasta, it creates a nice &#34;mac and cheese&#34; and is a good replacement for parmesan on spaghetti. If I'm in a hurry in the morning, it's super easy to sprinkle some on toast. It is easy to create a sauce with just some of these flakes and some soy milk or water (along with other spices depending on your taste), which can be added to steamed vegetables, rice, or any number of other foods. Delicious.I definitely recommend these for anyone struggling to incorporate enough nutrients and protein into their diet, or anyone who just wants to make what they already eat even better nutritionally. I can't compare the KAL Yeast Flakes to other brands because this is the only one I've tried, but that should say something: I haven't found the need to even try any others, because these ones are great.

The nutritional content makes it ideal for not just Vegans and Vegetarians, but all people who are looking to add flavor and remain health conscious.A very simple recipe that I use on a regular basis is to cut Firm Tofu into halves or quarters, squeeze the water out as much as possible. I then coat with Braggs Amino Acids, and yeast flakes. This gives it a very good texture and taste.

review/text: These flakes are a delicious addition to a lot of dishes. I initially got them for a healthy addition to soups. It adds a lot of savory, slightly cheese like flavor. I'll occasionally sprinkle some on meats or eggs I'm cooking in the pan. It's a little bit like using grated parmesean. It has a ton of B vitamins, so good for energy and a lot of other health benefits. I had never even heard of using this in cooking but I was pleasantly surprised and will be getting more. The canister is huge and should last a long time, even with me dumping the flakes on pretty liberally.

It is also fantastic sprinkled on a baked potato or roasted squash. It makes everything taste rich and cheesy. Without question, I am enjoying a very noticeable increase in physical energy and mental clarity since using this product. After just a couple days of use, I immediately reordered a large supply. This will remain a permanent fixture in my daily diet. I just wish I had known about it sooner!

And how can a parent not love a product that provides the benefits of added nutrition and great taste for the kids?

review/summary: Decent Option
review/text: These flakes (often powdery) are better priced (even when ~$15 for 22 oz) than anything available near the metropolitan area where I live. Used to pour this on everything possible before I got sick of the taste, now I sprinkle for a hint of cheesy taste and B12/nutrition.

review/text: We use Brewers Yeast for added flavor/texture on popcorn and other foods. Kal is the BEST tasting yeast flakes that we have found and the entire family loves it including our two young children. Best of all, it's low fat and very high in important nutrients. We can't seem to get enough of this stuff.

review/summary: Finger nails have improved!
review/text: I used to have really brittle fingernails that split and I could never keep my nails very long. No problem anymore! I will admit that when I first opened this package I thought this was the worst smelling substance ever but since I recently went no dairy and there are limited cheese substitutes out there and I also knew this was very nutritious (vit Bs, protein and fiber), I bit my lip and sprinkled it on my popcorn. OMG! By the end of that bowl I was licking my fingers! I am completely in LOVE and will have to buy another of these soon as this 22 oz container is running low after just a couple months! lol I would still describe the odor as 'icky' but it oddly makes my mouth water now. Besides you can't smell it much when it's sprinkled over popcorn or on a sandwich or mixed into a soup broth. But the most amazing thing is after less than 2 weeks of eating this (hard to say how much but maybe 2-3 tablespoons daily?) my fingernails became strong and they do not split horizontally like they used to. Love love love love love Nooch &#60;3

review/summary: Better than buying bulk
review/text: My first purchase of this product was from a local health food store which sells it loose in bins. I bought it as a vegan source of vitamin B12. The taste was ok but not something I would use as a flavoring agent. My Amazon purchase of the 22 oz. container was much fresher tasting so that now we also use it to enhance the taste of pasta and gravy. I add it to my oatmeal each morning and it does seem to increase my energy level throughout the day.

review/text: First off, this is a Huuuuge container! Bigger than I was expecting (about the size of a canister of oatmeal). Second, but most important, this nutritional yeast if yummy!! I had been buying in bulk at Whole Foods, but in my opinion this brand is better. Is is so fresh that the taste is better and the texture is awesome, almost with a little crunch to it, something that the other kind I used never had. Would definitely recommend it for sprinkling on veggies, popcorn, or using for all those yummy vegan "cheese" recipes.

Yummy! Now I can't imagine eating it any other way.

review/summary: Healthy Cheesy Flavor For Raw Vegans
review/text: I'm a raw vegan who sometimes misses the taste and texture of cheese. I'm really glad I bought nutritional yeast flakes because I can add it to all my raw vegan dishes for added flavor and texture. It makes everything taste cheesy and rich, and it's super nutritious and very affordable. A little goes a long way. I can make raw zucchini taste like macaroni and cheese! I can't wait to make cheesy kale chips in my dehydrator. I have had them before and they taste just like cheezits (but they are raw, green and healthy!)I know I'm getting my B vitamins when I consume nutritional yeast because it makes my pee bright yellow.

review/summary: Weight loss, energy boost, cat supplement
review/text: EDIT: A stray kitten came to us with Eosinophilic Granulomas (rodent ulcers or rodent mouth) Took three vets until we found out what was wrong. It was after repeated outbreaks of the lip sores this autoimmune disease causes that I began using Kal yeast in lieu of prednisone and clindamycin. He has been symptom free since, except for one time (last week)when stress triggered it after he escaped outside and became panicked. But after a few days of eating the yeast (in his food), he cleared up - and faster than the medical treatments we used before. I use about 1 T. per 5.5 oz. can. The best part is that he prefers his food with Kal yeast.First discovered this brand in 1978. Occasionally tried others, to my dismay. This one tastes great, I just grab a spoonful and enjoy eating it dry. Seems to give me an immediate lift that way, along with satisfying the type of "hunger" that drives me to eat high calorie snacks. Add it to my cats' canned food, too; we all like Kal Yeast Flakes!Local stores charge almost as much for the smaller size, and other web sites charge a higher price or much higher shipping. Wonderful that I can get this through Amazon! Otherwise, I'd be huffing and puffing up the hill to the local store to pay more.

review/summary: So Much Better Than the Dregs From the Bulk Bin
review/text: This nutritional yeast is the same stuff that you can find in the bulk bins at many health food stores. The upside is that it hasn't been pawed through by a zillion shoppers before you and the canister that it comes in is so much sturdier and easier to store in your pantry than the flimsy plastic bags found in most bulk food aisles.The reason that I gave it four stars instead of five is that it is the "small flake" nutritional yeast instead of the "large flake" that I prefer. Plus, although it has a good "cheesy" flavor and is great for using when making vegan dishes or as a topping for popcorn, it does have a very slightly bitter flavor to it that in my experience, some other brands of nutritional yeast don't seem to have.

My cats are addicted to it, and I sprinkle it on their food as well. It is rich in B vitamins and about a gazillion amino acids. I always get the blue label, and at this price it was a tremendous bargain. I bought it online because for some reason New York City was out of it. Go figure, I guess the secret is out!

review/text: Blends very easily. Has a mild taste. I put a scoop of nutritional yeast in my breakfast blender shakes (also has water, powdered milk and frozen berries or other fruit, and a sweetener such as stevia). Gives a great nutritional boost - and all those B vitamins are great for the "nerves' before a work day begins and I like the protein in it too. Have been taking yeast for 20 years - it did take a few weeks to get used to the taste when I began, since I only stirred it in milk. With the fruit and a little sweetener - it tastes really good.

review/summary: I'll have this with my "Nutritional Sugar Cookies"
review/text: When I saw the hefty vitamin content, I was at first cautiously pleased. Then I noticed the ingredient list. Most of the big % of RDA numbers (B vitamins) weren't in the yeast naturally. They were, essentially, the result of someone adding the equivalent of a few crushed up B-complex vitamins. Well, that's unfortunate. If I wanted a vitamin B complex tablet, I would just take one.What's more, some of the B vitamins (e.g., folic acid and B6) are of the variety that you may want to be careful not to oversupplement. I doubt the amount added to the yeast would actually create a problem (B6 and folic acid "overdoses" don't really make the news much), but I wanted healthy food here, not food plus extra synthetic (I presume) stuff that I hadn't planned on -- even if most people would argue that the addition is innocuous.Maybe most (or all?) nutritional yeast is this way -- I don't know;I'm no expert on the subject -- but this addition wasn't what I expected and it wasn't what I wanted. In sum, the nutritional yeast is reasonably tasty and I suppose I'll finish it at some point, but in the meantime I'll be looking for one that doesn't have the extra "fortification."

And it is even fortified with extra B-vitamins, Folic Acid, and B-12. Three tablespoons contains 150% of the RDA of B-12!

review/summary: Good tasting nutritional yeast with lots of folic acid reinforcement.
review/text: This yeast tastes better than some. The product has high folic acid reinforcement, five times the recommended total daily allowance in each serving according to the product label as of late 2011. This extra folic acid might be a good thing, might be too much of a good thing, might be a bad thing, or might not make any difference to health. A popular-press medical negative alarm around the year 2010 over the issue of too much folic acid in the diet, or too high a RBC folate level in the blood, I'm not sure which, may have been misleading and both Dr. Kelly Robinson of California and Chris A., a health care professional of Maine say in the comments below, comments posted to an earlier version of this customer review, if I understand correctly, to not worry much if at all about negative health effects of high levels of folic acid in food.

review/summary: I can't use this in place of parmesan cheese
review/text: The taste is not what I expected - I expected it to taste good and I didn't like the flavor. I mixed it with pesto because I normally use parmesan. It ruined the pesto. Not a big fan of it as a cheese replacement, however, I'm using it as a nutritional supplement for home-made bread - the flavor doesn't come out in the bread. So for nutrition it's good, but not so good for taste.

review/summary: KAL Nutritional Yeast
review/text: I am not a vegetarian, but was looking for a natural way to get more B vitamins into my diet. The noted serving is 3 heaping tablespoons, but I have reduced this to one, as I found the flavor to be very overpowering. But even at one tablespoon it is increasing my vitamin intake considerably. I prefer to taste the food that I am eating and not just the toppings that I put on, so I am experimenting with each meal by putting a spoonful on my plate and dipping my food into it rather than just sprinkling it over everything. I feel this is a good alternative to taking another vitamin pill.

review/summary: Impressed
review/text: I'm a vegetarian and had never heard of nutritional yeast. I found it in an online recipe for tofu bacon, and purchased it for that purpose. Some people say it has a nutty or cheesy flavor... To me it has a meaty flavor, but I can see the "cheesy part". I haven't tried any other brands of nutritional yeast, for whatever it's worth. That said, this definitely added a LOT of flavor to the tofu bacon. The end result of the recipe wouldn't exactly be something I would call "bacon", but it was really, really good in its own right. After refrying up some of the leftovers (which had a chance for the flavors to sit), I got the distinct impression that I was eating slices of pork roast. A lot of that I attribute to the nutritional yeast. Part of the reason this stuff is so good is that it contains a LOT of glutamic acid. This amino acid is of course present in MSG, among many other completely natural, healthy things. Do I feel like I'm being naughty by adding this to things? Not really. It tastes good, and it has nutritional value (a complete protein I believe?) for a vegetarian.

review/text: We, the family is not vegetarian but I thought we could use the natural vitamins that brewers yeast contain.

review/text: I really wanted to like this, but it is just not something I seem to be able to adjust my taste buds to. I had read reviews other omnivores liked it, and it wasn't just for vegans or vegetarians, so thought it would be better than it is. The quality of the product seems fine - even flakes and nice color, but oh, the taste is something that ruins oatmeal or anything else I've tried it in.

review/text: Though the item that arrived was not this picture, it is the same 22 oz KAL Nutritional Yeast flakes I purchased before and I'm very satisfied. It takes a little while to get used to the taste but now I put it on pretty much everything. I agree it's slightly cheesy, a little salty tasting (to me), but I really do sprinkle it on pretty much everything savory or spicy. 3 TBS for 9 protein and it's just yummy. Great product, have purchased again, will purchase again.

review/summary: Nutty flavor
review/text: Thanks to nutritionist Kimberly Snyder's book The Beauty Detox Solution, I changed the way I eat. In her book, she recommends substituting cheese for Yeast Flakes. Expecting a cheesy flavor, I was surprised that this is more of a nutty flavor. I read all of the reviews so I knew the expect this. I love putting this on my salad and have no complaints that it doesn't exactly taste like cheese. I will add it to my popcorn next time just to see how the flavor will taste then but for now, I'm 100% satisfied with the quality and taste of these yeast flakes.

review/summary: Great taste and price
review/text: My girlfriend and I love this stuff. She puts some on her salad every day. We use it with ground sesame seed 50/50 as a topping in place of parmesan and for popcorn. The best use of it so far though is for delicious cheese sauces. We make up about a quart and a half of cheese sauce by using a cup and a half of this with tofu, oil, garlic powder, soy sauce and paprika. Pour it over a pound of cooked noodles like macaroni and bake it for a while and you have rich mac and "cheese".When I'm eating lots of this Nutritional yeast I notice feeling more energetic. It's loaded with B vitamins and protein.Check vegweb for the actual recipe. I think it's "Best mac and cheese in the world, seriously" or something like that. I also use it for a breakfast scramble. Just fry up the potatoes, onions, peppers and whatever you want, then pour on some sauce and let it cook down for a minute or two. Delicious!Some people find something a bit funny about the taste of Nutritional Yeast. But like most things, if you don't go in with an expectation of how it should taste (many people are expecting cheese), you may really like it. I find that it's a more pungent style of cheese like flavor like a sharp cheddar.The KAL brand is excellent also. It's essentially the same strain of yeast that is sold under other labels. Red Star Nutitional Yeast 40240 "vegetarian support formula" from what I've gathered. Which is usually considered the best tasting variety.

review/summary: Perfect on popcorn! Healthy for you!
review/text: It's difficult to find flakes of yeast. I like it on home-made popcorn fresh off the stove.It adds a buttery taste to it, and the flakes catch in the crooks and crevices of the popped corn.Discovered it in Portland, OR at an art theater downtown, where they had it in a shaker, next toparmesean cheese and salt, etc.About once a month I HAD to go to that theater, no matter what movie was showing,and have some popcorn with brewer's yeast on it. Finally figured out it was right beforemy menstral cycle, and my body craved B vitamins, which this stuff is packed full of.This is a big container of it, and should last quite a while.I'll tell you, finding FLAKED brewer's years is difficult way down here in my area.

I've made some "creamy" cheese-like substances with it, which taste good but only resemble cheese in yellow color and maybe a melted texture, not so much taste.It suggests mixing some with warm water for a snack. I tried this once, and there was no way it was for me, too strong by itself.Cheaper per ounce than my local health food store.

review/text: Ladies if you are pregnant or trying to conceive, taking nutritional yeast is a wonderful food-based way to build up folic acid levels in early pregnancy. Also, it was effective in stopping morning sickness for me. Taking vitamin B-6 has been linked with reducing morning sickness, and nutritional yeast has it in abundance along with a wide range of other B-vitamins. If this is not enough, it's high in protein and tastes delish. I love it!

review/summary: Please sir, may I have some more? On second thought....
review/text: Yes, Kal yeast flakes are quite tasty like the other reviewers are saying. Before buying this brand, I had been buying Red Star Nutritional Yeast from my local store and dumping it on lots of things, on salads, in smoothies, on popcorn. I'm a borderline vegetarian and wasn't taking any B supplements so I figured that the yeast was a good idea. But as has been noted, it's pretty expensive. The Kal brand is a better deal and I just fill an old 5 oz Red Star container to make it easier to dispense. (I slightly prefer the Red Star product hence the 4 stars.) There is a point I must sadly bring up, though, and it's that if you use a heavy hand, you may see "results" where you don't want them. According to the label, 3 rounded tablespoons are 80 calories. By the time you've scarfed down the whole cannister of yeast flakes, you'll have consumed almost 2500 calories. So if you are wont to get a little crazy when you find a food you like, it might be worth remembering!

review/summary: Delicious Yeast Flakes, Brew Ha Ha ..folic acid?
review/text: Nutritional yeast flakes have been part of my diet from a toddler, 62 years. Ma would make these wild milk shakes with soy protein, brewers yeast, blackstrap molasses, she called it "tigers milk" the yeast's nutty flavor with the sweet kiss of molasses...out of this world.Mix red pepper, garlic powder and brewers yeast, put that on your popcorn you'll forget all about butter, A table spoon in my coffee(8:00 arabica) endless possibilities, even the dogs benefit as yeast helps repel parasites, fleas, etc.I am also fighting chronic anemia so for me the folic acid isn't an issue but I certainly have paid attention to the issues in many of the comments. It is good to bring attention to the fact that everything in moderation is a reasonably good approach and doing homework on your own unique situation is the best approach of all.

review/summary: Pretty good
review/text: I like this better than some I've had, but it does have a hint of bitterness compared to some (Bob's, mainly). This isn't really noticeable when used in recipes so it's only an issue when I'm sprinkling it straight onto foods. The flakes also seem smaller than many other brands I've used, making it dissolve a little quicker. I also think the flake size should be taken into account when measuring tried and true recipes, I think the actual weight would be a little heavier compared cup by cup for this.If rating for price for amount and quality only I would give this the full 5 stars-it's a great deal-but going on just the product itself, I give 4 stars because of the slight bitterness issue.

review/summary: Kal Nutritional Yeast Flakes
review/text: I love this stuff! Nutritional yeast is a little expensive for the most part, especially in local stores. Buying in bulk is your best option, especially if you're like me and are addicted to the stuff. I'm glad I found this product (I purchased the 22 oz size, by the way). It's cheap and lasts quite a while. Nutritional yeast has a nutty, cheesy sort of flavor (try toasting it before using it in recipes), and can also impart a chicken-type flavor. I'm constantly making vegan "cheese" sauces and adding it to broths and gravies for a savory taste. It can be an acquired taste - some people love it right away; most have to grow into it. I didn't really like it at first, but now I'm obsessed with the stuff (similar to tofu).I recommend VegWeb.com for yummy recipes; the Tangy Cheeseless Cheese Sauce is my favorite! Try sprinkling it straight onto popcorn and pasta dishes. Bryanna Clark Grogan has a recipe for "Chicken-Style Broth Powder" using mainly nutritional yeast.BONUS: It's actually good for you! It's packed with amino acids, minerals, and B vitamins, including B12 (which all vegans should know is hard to get from a vegan diet). It's low in sodium and fat, and is suitable for most selective diets.

review/summary: Healthy for dieters
review/text: If you've never tried nutritional yeast before, I would suggest trying it out! I have replaced cheeses with nutritional yeast for the added nutritional benefits and lower calorie content. The substitution has worked well in salads, scrabled eggs, soups, sandwiches. This might sound silly, but I've actually started prefering the nutritional yeast to shredded cheeses because I have come to love the taste so much! Make sure that whatever you add this to isn't too dry of an item, or the yeast's texture would be too dry.This brand through amazon has been a great choice for me because it is convenient and cheaper than in the specialty grocery stores. I highly recommend it!

review/summary: Absolutely love Kal Yeast Flakes
review/text: I can't say enough about this product. I'm so happy that it is being sold on Amazon.com. And I'm happy to see such wonderful overall reviews. I've been taking Kal Yeast Flakes for years. There's nothing quite like it, in my book. It has amino acids, minerals and a powerhouse of B vitamins which I've always heard are great for the nervous system. I don't know what it is, but I always seem to feel a bit more clear-minded and levelheaded throughout the day after I've had my morning dose (a tablespoonful or two in apple or orange juice). Nice to have in the evening sometimes, too.This is a product that I've used and trusted for a long time. Wouldn't want to be without it.

review/summary: Popcorn, Spaghetti -- More, Please.
review/text: I bought this for the first time on a whim about three months ago. Love it, love it, love it. Love it on popcorn, crave it on my spaghetti (with a touch of parmesian cheese added to it). I eat spaghetti for lunch maybe four to five times a week now (no sauce). Don't know if that's good or bad, but I heap the nutritional yeast on it and love it. I'm definitely not a vegan (not that there's anything wrong with that, I just love me meats), but I feel good that this product is so full of nutrients. I don't know how it compares to other brands. I bought this brand first and it tastes great to me, plus the price is cheaper than some others out there, so I figure, why buy anything else?

review/summary: Great yeast flakes
review/text: I honestly can't think of anything bad to say about this product. Tastes great and is inexpensive compared to other nutritional yeast offerings. Comes in a nice resealable cardboard (oatmeal style) tube - and 22 oz of yeast flakes is a LOT! My kids love it on pasta & bagels - basically anywhere you would use sprinkle cheese. In fact, my kids now usually ask for 'yellow cheese' on stuff. Great product and great price.

review/summary: YUMMY CHEESY FLAVORED GOODNESS!
review/text: I didn't buy it off amazon, but I recently purchased a can at my local health food store and it does have a cheesy flavor. It reminds me of the flavoring on snack foods like Doritos. The smell isn't as appetizing, but it doesn't bother me. I love sprinkling it on my pasta dishes, it has such a delicious nutty flavor. I also notice a huge surge in my energy levels after eating it too.

review/text: Makes a lot of things delicious (who would imagine that something with a name like "yeast flakes" could taste good?) Use instead of salt, sugar, many other empty or harmful ingredients. Get B-complex and other nutrients in a natural, tasty form. Spoon it into your milk, yoghurt, cocoa, hot or cold cereal, soups, veggies, sauces, salad dressing, popcorn, ice cream, your mouth, whatever. I even load my morning coffee with it; it adds a smooth and pleasantly "malty" flavor. Keeps forever at room temp.This review is mostly for newbies who could use a nudge of encouragement to try something that sounds strange; remember, life is full of pleasures that seemed strange the first time!

review/summary: Be brave and just try it ! Put it in Yogurt or Applesauce
review/text: My secret weapon to perform hard work with a great attitude. Guanine (a caffeine analog) gives a long lasting stimulant boost while theobromine provides the attitude adujstment of chocolate. A wonderful delight that got me to quit coffee which is jittery, short-acting and just pale in comparison.Guanine is oil-based so it's hard to dissolve in water but that allows for slow-release in your body. Be brave, depending on your body size use a teaspoon to a tablespoon. If you can consume a tablespoon of coffee you can certainly consume a tbsp of this.Instead of trying to dissolve into liquid put it in Yogurt or Apple Sauce. Makes a great low calorie breakfast that stays with you and reduces hunger.Truly an amazing product that leaves a six-hour silly grin on my face with motivation to clean the garage !

review/text: This stuff is fantastic. I agree with the other complimentry reviews. might i suggest mixing a small amount of this powder with a shot of olive oil?! I actually think it may lengthen the effect even mnore by doing this and it is a fat soluble so it's a lot easier to get down. Because of the chemistry of this molecule, it is bitter and never tastes good. If it really bothers you, it's possible to order some gelatin capsules and make your own guarana capsules! That way you can swallow them and will not have to deal with the taste:)

review/summary: A note to the coffee lovers
review/text: I've had a few of WP's coffees before, which were fine. This medium light roast I purchased recently "Tuscan breakfast" was undrinkable. Yes, it smelled fresh and robust. Thats where the kind adjectives end. I brewed 2 pots of this acidic, bitter, and harsh beverage that I wouldnt wish on anyone first thing in the morning, before deciding to spare you all the same fate... A better name might have been "Industrial Byproduct". Of course, some people feel thats what makes a REAL coffee. But if this came to a my table at a restaurant, I would have been, to say the least, dissatisfied.A little side note for those purchasing this or one of the more acceptable blends... the bag is a nightmare to open. Save yourself the frustration and grab a scissors. Cut the whole top off which seems welded together down to the wire wrap.

review/text: These looked wonderful and were a birthday present for a close friend. When they came the foil was all stuck to the candy. We tried to unwrap a couple and it made a bigger mess with the paper sticking terribly to the candy. In the end we were able to taste the tiniest piece which just made us more disappointed and angry since it was delicious. We would never order these again or do business with this company. And living in Florida was not the problem since we paid BIG prices for the candy and shipping, it was not hot and the package was literally put in our hands from the truck, so it didn't sit outside. Big Big disappointment.

review/summary: Great Museli.
review/text: One of my local grocery stores carries some Familia products. Their Muselis are very good in general, but this Swiss Crunch with seeds is one of my favorites. It is very satisfying (I eat it cold with some Silk Light Vanilla soy milk) and the seeds add an interesting variation to the fruit bits in most of the Muselis I've tried. Amazon's price is great too.

review/summary: I began buying this product in Dubai.
review/text: For several years, I religiously carted bags home in my suitcase purchased at the French grocery store Carrefour in Dubai. Then this particular mix disappeared from the shelves.AT first I thought I had introduced too many colleagues to the "Best Cereal Ever". I only eat this particular cereal and mix it with organic yogurt and fresh fruit. Especially tasty with fresh peaches.After emailing Familia to inquire about the problem, I was pleasantly surprised to receive notification that they had a vendor in the US and I turned to Amazon.I am much happier now that Amazon delivers my cereal to my back door... just in case I am in Dubai when it arrives. Ahhh, the life of an International Flight Attendant!

review/summary: An Excellent and Healthy Choice for Anyone's Diet
review/text: A quality product from Bio-familia, a Swedish company that developed "Bircherm&uuml;esli" a product so popular and successful that made the name Muesli famous all over the world.If you need a high fiber and protein snack option for your diet, this is absolutely a very good product. You can't go wrong and the best of all: excellent taste and quality, and for a pack of five this comes at a good value.Sometimes your diet will require you eat frequently and consciously, and in those cases you need to have a snack at hand when you get hungry, in order to keep your metabolism high all day long. In such cases finding a good and balance option could be hard. I love this 5-pack and I always have one at home an another pack at the office. I try to eat five or more times a day, so in my case having a healthy snack at hand wherever I am when I get hungry is a priority.Since you are checking this product I have to guess that you are probably a person that cares about what you eat, either because you are interested in losing weight, getting in better shape or just be healthier and keep in good shape, so I will share my own experience in the weight loss game and staying in shape gameMy own successful personal experience in weight loss is based on strategies to boost metabolism. Don't stress yourself, eat frequently, eat just what you need each time, and choose wisely what you are going to eat, supplement your diet. Yet simple and it works. I loss more than 200 lbs and shrink my waist (from 44 to 32), and I have been able to keep in good shape since then. Every single aspect of my life has improved since then.Keep in mind that a good diet is just part of the equation, you also need a plan that helps you keep on track and monitor your condition. Based on my own personal experience I can recommend some tools that you may want to consider, to establish your own strategies for boosting your metabolism, loosing weight, and even more important keeping that weight off. They are:- "Ultrametabolism: The Simple Plan for Automatic Weight Loss" by Mark Hyman. A practical an realistic plan for weigh loss.- "The ABS Diet", which is another very practical, readable, insightful, and inspirational book, that also includes an exercise plan.- A Body Fat Monitor or Scale. This will help you monitor your progress, to assure that the weight you are loosing is fat (fat lost = increased metabolism) and not muscle, water or bone mass (decreased metabolism).- A Heart Rate Monitor Wrist Watch. This is an excellent tool that will help you monitor and control your Heart Rate in order to keep yourself in a burning fat state (increased metabolism).- "Heart Monitor Training for the Complete Idiot", a primer on the use of Heart Rate Monitors for health improvement or weight control.If you want to star focusing only on your diet, the first two may be worth considering. If you exercise, or want to start doing it right, the last threee are for you. If you do both, all the recommended options can improve your results.I am 39 years old, With the help of the tools I just mentioned not only I went fro size 44 to size 32 pants, but also obtained substantial benefits that included weight control, cardiovascular improvements, lowered blood pressure, and improved muscular-skeletal strength and flexibility, but also the myriad of mental and psychological benefits derived from being in the best shape of my life.

review/summary: Malty Breakfast.
review/text: Given that it was a Scotsman - a 19th century Edinburgh tea master named Drysdale - who first marketed his particular blend under the name "breakfast tea" (and given that Drysdale's creation would soon come to be (mis)appropriated by tea houses south of the border, who proceeded to add the word "English" to its name), it seems only fitting that the Scots should have their own version of breakfast tea, too, after all. Even stronger than the already potent English Breakfast blend, this particular one is made to match not only the traditionally heavy English but even the Scottish breakfast, which like the English variety includes pork, sausages and eggs, but is amplified by that so distinctly Caledonian culinary creation: haggis (to most of the rest of the world, a classic case of "acquired taste" at best). A blend of primarily Indian teas, Scottish Breakfast contains a particularly high percentage of Assam, which with its malty flavor ideally complements the soft Scottish mountain waters ... as well as Scotland's famous single malt whiskies, the "water of life" ("uisgue beatha") likewise coming from the areas where those same mountain waters are flowing.Due to its strength, Scottish Breakfast tea maintains its flavor very well with the addition of cream or milk. As an everyday "work horse" and early morning pick-me-up it is easily as good as (if not better than) its more famous sibling from south of the border, or any kind of coffee. Enjoy!

review/text: I really love this tea, and I cannot start the day without it. It has a full bodied and malty flavor. I like it with a little milk, but it's also great on its own. I wish the leaves were whole, as is the Taylors' Assam, Doomur Dulling, but that is my only nick against it. I've tried both, and I still prefer the taste and fully body of the Scottish Breakfast Tea.

A mouth orgy!Use a small amount in a home made viniagrette salad dressing with a few threads of saffron and pour over crisp butter lettuce with red pear slices and tiny clumps of Humboldt Fog Blue cheese.Take a slice of fresh Italian Calabrese or French peasant bread and dip it in the oil and let your toungue dance with pleasure.You'll wonder where this oil has been hiding all these years.

review/text: This product arrived with the box broken open which had been put back together with packing tape. The perforated display box was punched open and I received only 11 of the 12 packages that where originally in the box. The shipper should have put the display box inside a regular brown shipping box in order to avoid this problem. I'm giving 3 stars because the sunflower kennels were fresh and very good, however, because of this problem I am reluctant to order this product again fearing that I might receive fewer than 11 packages next time. I've decided to place my next order with another company through Amazon.

My order arrived with six months to go before the expiration date and I found that even after they had "expired" by about a month or two they were still very good.

It costs money to ship returns. Shame on you.esther jones

review/text: I have a case of 8.5 ounce packages sent to me every-other month.Normally, I am quite satisfied with what I receive.So far every package in this last order - I just opened package #7 out of 12- is consistantly sunflower seeed dust. I must have received the packages that were filled with the last of the stuff in the bottom of the bin at the factory.The problem is that because I received one case from one specific packaging period at the factory - they are ALL like that. If I had bought them at a retail store one or two at a time, I probably would have only gotten one or two out of 12 bags of this quality.YUK!

review/text: I buy organic cranberry beans in 25-50 lb lots. They are a staple in our household. I had hoped to buy some from Barry Farm, and assumed - from their name - that they grew them. After all, they are a "farm," right? Understanding that some "organic" beans come from China, I thought I would call Barry Farms to confirm the country of origin for their beans. The female who took my call told me that they don't know where these beans come from since they get them from a distributor (so much for the "farm" in "Barry Farms"). I asked if she could give me the contact information for the distributor so that I could ask them directly. Her answer: "no". I asked if THEY could find out from the distributor where these beans come from. Her answer: "no". Thanks, but I'll do my business elsewhere.UPDATE: I ended up buying from Italian Harvest - a dot com.SECOND UPDATE: Italian Harvest no longer has an organic Borlotti/Cranberry bean, so this year I purchased from Purcell Mountain Farms, and am very pleased with their product.

review/summary: Great Gift for Butter Lover
review/text: This was a gift for my father-in-law who loves to enjoy butter with bread or crackers. It was somewhat of a joke gift, but he loved it. I am told that he guarded his &#34;fancy&#34; butter from regular use and insisted it was only for special enjoyment.

review/summary: Afternoon Darjeeling Tea-Fits Me to a Tea!
review/text: I will definitely buy more. I brew all Darjeeling teas strong with distilled water and sweeten with sugar. I like the temperature to be between warm and hot which brings out the flavor. The beautiful clear amber-rose color makes me eager to drink my first glass of the day. This is what gets me out of bed in the morning! Anticipation! The delivery was tops. I love the reasonable price for this premium tea. The packaging is excellent as I always move my teas to a metal container as some teas do not come in a tin. I am very satisfied and pleased with this one.

review/summary: Odd
review/text: I called Barry Farm and spoke with two women to find out if there is any possible gluten contamination with the beans. Neither knew if the beans could have gluten on them because they are from a supplier and don't actually grow them. When I asked who the supplier was she rather curtly said, "I will not give out the names of my suppliers". I found that odd, on so many levels, and wondered if her suppliers are in China. A company has never refused to give me their supplier before. The best part was telling me I could wash the gluten off when I rinsed the beans. Due to all the recall mania, I am not willing to gamble my family's health. Anyone else wondering what they do grow at Barry Farm? The whole thing left me with the heebie-jeebies.

review/summary: om nom nom
review/text: Bragg products are kind of strange. Without exception, every one I have ever had is a high-quality handcrafted old fashioned artisan condiment. They are sensitive to people with allergies, and have detailed labels that help show exactly what is in everything they make. Bragg products are also made by actual, bona fide crazy people. They're some kind of hilarious vinegar-cult, with bible quotes all over their bottles and website, and links to articles about how fluoride is deadly poison, and drinking glasses of vinegar will make you live forever, and the world seed cartels are trying to murder apple trees, and gulf war syndrome was caused by the deadly neurotoxin Nutra-Sweet. I mean, seriously. These people are ACTUALLY crazy. But they make delicious products. This one is no exception.It's a surprisingly hearty asian-style dressing that goes well on absolutely any kind of veggies, or as a meat marinade. It's delicate while still being robust, mostly due to the use of the Bragg Aminos. They're a soy-sauce substitute that is less salty and more savory, with big round mouth-feel. In this application it works very well. The ginger and sesame flavors are pronounced without being overwhelming, and the honey and garlic still have enough room to come thorough. This dressing would be a good choice even if it wasn't super healthy, but the health benefits just make it a slam dunk. Awesome stuff. You don't have to be a deranged conspiracy wing-nut to enjoy good salads.

review/text: Overall the flavor is that of apple cider vinegar rather than the ginger or sesame, but I know people who are not vinegar people and still love this dressing. It is very refreshing on salads and you just seem to feel better after eating it! I often put it on just tomatoes or just cucumbers and let it marinate for a while before eating. My only complaint is that the bottle can be a little leaky at first if you don't remove the sealing disk, and you really need to shake it up well when you first open it to prevent the first few servings from being too oily.

review/summary: Yummy, but little or no sesame or ginger flavor
review/text: I'm a great fan of Bragg's aminos, and so was delighted when I saw the Ginger & Sesame salad dressing for sale, and bought a bottle.It is very tasty mild salad dressing, and I can see sesame seeds floating around, and something shredded which is presumably ginger. The dressing is a yummy sweat-sour--which I presume from Bragg's Apple Vinegar and honey, but I can detect no sesame nor ginger flavor. Unlike other reviewers, I do not taste any hint of Bragg's Aminos in "Ginger & Sesame Salad Dressing" (even though it is listed among the ingredients), in anycase, it could use alot more.The biggest problem I have with premixed "oil and vinegar" dressings is that if you put them in the frig, the oil solidifies---meaning you have to wait a half-an-hour everytime you want to use the oil. Leaving the dressing "out", here in the tropics, is inadvisable. In addition, I find salad dressings from which the components settle out in a few seconds to be annoying, forcing me to shake-and-pour, shake-and-pour, shake-and-pour. However, oil and vinegar, separately, do NOT have to be refrigerated, and do not have to be shaken. If you want an oil-and-vinegar dressing, it is better to simply use oil, vinegar (or lemon juice) and spices separately:For a moderately premium olive oil, I recommend ColavitaColavita Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 34-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)For vinegar, you can use Bragg's Apple Vinegar.Bragg - Apple Cider Vinegar, 32 oz liquidor a nice balsalmic vinegar. However fresh lemon juice (and a little lemon zest) is much better.Microplane 40020 Classic Zester/GraterIf you want sesame flavor, mix a little sesame oil with your oil, or drizzle it on separately. For example:Kadoya - Pure Sesame Oil 5.5 Oz.Dry sesame seeds are also available in the spice section of most grocery stores, which you can sprinkle on salads. For example:Bob's Red Mill White Sesame Seeds, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)If you want ginger flavor, grate a little fresh ginger over your salad using the microplane zester. My grocery sells tubes of minced ginger in the cool-foods section---the tubes are almost as good as fresh ginger. Dried ginger is available in the spice section of your grocery. For example:GINGER GROUND FRESHLY PACKED IN LARGE JARS, spices, herbs, seasoningsFor example:S&B; - Oroshi (Shoga ginger paste) in tube 1.41 Oz.Instead of salt, spinkle a little Braggs Aminos on your salad.Otherwise, I prefer stiff mayonaise-based dressings. They can be refrigerated without solidifying, and "stick" to the vegies better. I usually add flavors and spices (fresh ginger, cilantro, garlic, lemon zest, minced olives, minced dill pickle, mustard seeds, etc.) to mayonaise, as needed for the particular salad or vegetable dish I plan to serve. Similar homemade mayo-based condiment makes a super sandwich spread, a "sauce" for vegetables side-dishes, or a dip for battered fish, "french" fries, tempura, etc. For non-leafy salads and for vegetables, I often serve the dressing "on the side" and use it more as a dip.Conclusion: Braggs Ginger & Sesame salad dressing is a good salad dressing, but I like something a little more convenient and flavorful.General RecommendationAfter major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your reciept, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon. When you find items (even if more expensive than you just paid), put the item on your Amazon wish list, and add a note to the wish list of the price you just paid. Check your wish list frequently, and when you see an item you need at a bargain price, buy it. If you watch, you'll be surprised by how radically and quickly the prices on Amazon can change. I've seen many examples of prices doubling (or dropping in half) over an hour's time. $5.49 (the price at the time of this writting is a good price---I just paid $7.15 at a local grocery).

On the box it tells you not to drink more than 1 cup in a 24 hour period- I drank three the other day not even thinking about it and nothing happened! Just tasted like cranberry tea and nothing else.

review/text: I bought this product based off reviews saying it tastes great and I was extremely disappointed. As soon as I started steeping it this smell filled my kitchen (my daughter even asked what the horrible smell was). Sadly, it was this tea. I tried it and it tastes like sweaty socks also. It is so gross. I have tried adding honey, drinking it cold, drinking it hot, etc and they all taste horrible. As far as a diet aid, I don't think so. I guess if you had a lot of excrement in you, possibly. I even doubled the suggested amount and I still did not anything happen (and no, I was not on the toilet a lot either). All in all, this product was a big thumbs down to me.

If you let it steep for the recommended two minutes, you shouldn't have to run to the bathroom like your pants are on fire! If you let it steep for the 2 minutes, it's a decent trip to the bathroom...not explosive diarrhea.With the way we eat (mostly women) we need to clean out our plumbing every once in a while and this is a fabulous way to do it. It's not recommended for everyday use!

review/summary: Cinnamon Spice
review/text: I did not buy this tea through amazon.. But from my grandmothers cabinet(haha). I have been dieting for the past 3 months now, and i was completely oblivious to special teas for cleansing although i know of drinks/pills that cleanse, I wanted to steer clear of any type of pill and again oblivious to benefits of cleansing(even when not dieting). Now I tried this tea two months ago & only because of the words "Super Dieters" I thought ohh special tea so i drank it(in the evening) it did for me do its job and loosen things up which i found odd at first then i read the package, and then I got it. So for me it did help being that I usually dont um go as much as I should and this has helped that. Not only that but since I have been using it along with my eatting habits, and exercise my diet has been showing better results nothing drastic but still better results and that is always great! This tea (Cinnamon Spice) I think tastes devine, I do add not even a teaspoon of sugar but I think this tea doesn't even need sugar at all(i just like it sweeter). But all in all I do and have recommended this tea to a few family members and friends(who do and dont diet) because i love the taste and the results I'm having with it.

review/summary: Lightly Cinnamon, Decent Tea, Medicinally Works
review/text: When doing a low-carb diet, constipation can often be a problem, especially in the beginning stages when the carbs are the most restrictive. It's a complaint many people have about low-carbing. Now, if you're doing it right, it shouldn't be that way, but sometimes it just happens. Also, someone with chronic illnesses and also those who take pain medication regularly might find themselves with a bout of constipation too. So while I know this is called a 'dieter's tea' and I know that some people use it for cleansing and even for dangerous weight loss by drinking too much of it to 'flush out' the foods they eat, this tea can actually be used safely and for good purposes when used properly for constipation relief.It takes a little bit to find the right level of brewing to make this work for you. Too little, and it doesn't do much, too much and you'll explode and run to the bathroom almost right after drinking it. Find the right balance, the right steeping level vs. water for you, and you'll simply have a normal, easy relief the next morning. Once or twice per week, after a meal, works great for most folks I've talked to. Works wonderful for me when needed.The flavor is great too. I've tried the other flavors of this brand, and I don't like them. My best friend likes the lemon though, so to each their own, but for me, the cinnamon is the best. It's lightly sweet on its own, but sometimes I'll still add a little honey.Good stuff, and if properly steeped, it doesn't cause cramping or pain or unflattering gas, with a decent taste. Definitely recommend if it's something you need.

review/summary: really disappointed
review/text: though i did not purchase this through amazon, i did get this recently from thw grocery store, and have to admit im really disappointed. i followed the instructions the first evening EXACTLY as instructed with the included paper, and no results. the second day, i brewed just a little longer, still no luck, (basing this off some other comments from other users here on amazon) then today i only did 6oz, not 12 as the paper instructs, and even brewed this for 6 minutes. still nothing.i really wanted this to work for me like it has for others, i had heard good things and was so excited, but still no luck. i guess im one of those people this doesnt affect. ill keep trying it daily till i run out, but looks like ill have to try something else.as for taste, its not bad. just tastes like tea leaves, not deliciously fantastic, but not nose-pinchingly undrinkable. good luck to anyone else. hope you have more success with this than i did

review/summary: It's changed a bit, but still does the job...
review/text: I've used this product for the last 15 or so years and it is good for one primary thing: To get you going. I don't really know why they call it a &#34;diet&#34; tea, since it doesn't help you burn fat, give you energy, curb your appetite, boost your metabolism etc.That said, this is my #1 go-to item for constipation. My grandmother is 92, and when she came to live with me, she had been nervous about the move etc. Long story short, she was &#34;plugged up&#34; and hadn't gone in nearly two weeks. She has had a kidney removed, so the Dr. said to steer clear of any magnesium based products. So knowing that, I tried a more natural approach.I tried the orange fiber powder, green tea with honey, prune juice, apple juice, and after nothing had worked, laxatives for three straight days.... And still nothing!So this had been sitting in my cupboard for ages, and I remembered that when I had used this, it sent me to the bathroom.I gave her a large cup of this and by the next afternoon...well, let's just say &#34;Laci Le Beau helped her go, go go.&#34;She still has problems with regularity, so every 4 days, I give her a cup of this to keep everything in order.I'd give this five stars, but the new bags are VERY flimsy. With the old bags, I would let them steep for 15 minutes, squeeze the bag to get the strong oils out, and steep again for another 15 or so...The other day I was using the new 2012 bags and was using a hot/cold office (5 gallon bottles) dispenser. I put the teabag in the cup and the force of the water actually burst the bag open as I was filling the cup. I had tea leaf bits floating in my cup. Whatever material they are using now is so weak, I'll have to add the teabag to the water after the cup is full. I certainly won't be able to squeeze the last bits of oils out of the leaves now...Still worth 4 stars though. Oh and one more thing... I add some lemon juice and honey to this. It tastes really good that way.

review/text: I never drink this tea alone. I always steep it with another tea, such as Oolong or Jasmine because the taste isn't the best. I use honey and sugar to sweeten and down the hatch it goes! Expect some, um, gastrointestinal responses the next day. Sometimes I feel a bit of cramping and sometimes I don't. Sometimes it will take most of the next day for it to 'work'...and sometimes it won't!!

review/summary: They make you poop
review/text: I'm going to talk about poop in my review, so if that offends you, please skip reading this! I've tried the "original" flavor (which is... herb-y and kind of gross), but this is a review for the cinnamon spice (which is still slightly herb-y, but tastes pretty decent.)I never understand why these teas are marketed as "dieter's tea". Don't use this to lose weight. The only weight you'll lose is from all that crap and water you're expelling from your bowels (literally crap. I made a poop joke. Hehe. Okay, sorry. Back to my review.)If you want to lose weight, eat less "standard American diet" foods, eat more veggies, and move more. The end. Seriously, don't use this as your weight loss method. I've tried it, and it just gives you stomach cramps for a few weeks, and you'll lose more friends than pounds because basically you just have diarrhea all the time.The real purpose of the product? It's for pooping.This is a laxative tea for when you're constipated. If you've never had this before, here's what I discovered about a decade ago, when I was a teenager with body image issues and found my mom's "dieter's tea": brewed myself a huge cup (kept the teabag in), chugged it, spent the next night and day with wild stomach cramping and diarrhea. Lovely, am I right? To combat this, keep the brew times short, especially at first. You should feel... something... within 24 hours.Overusing laxatives will make you have even more bowel problems. It contains senna, which is a "natural" compound, but your body will start to get used to it, and you'll need more and more, every time, and suddenly your anus is either leaking or so clenched up that you can't poop without help. Apparently, you can use it safely up to 30 days, but I personally don't use it more than 2 days in a row, and I pretty much only use it if for whatever reason (stress, forgetting to eat any veggies/fruits, etc) I have been constipated for more than 2 days. I like it better than senna tablets, but it's hard to control how strong the tea will be.If you're chronically constipated, I would personally suggest using this a few days a week, and supplementing your diet with a fiber supplement likeVitafusion Fiber Gummies 220 Count Sugar Freeor by adding a bunch of fibrous plants/veggies and other natural sources of fiber into your diet.)If you're into "cleanses", holyyy mother, this will make you feel pretty empty inside, like an angsty teenager. Just take a few strong cups, brace yourself through the cramping, and prepare to feel nice and clean inside. Don't do this too often, though, and don't do this if you need to work the next day.The cinnamon spice flavor tastes pretty good, but not a super strong cinnamon taste, as I expected/hoped. The box I got came with 2 medium-sized plastic bags (sealed) of tea bags. The tea bags that I got are pretty well constructed. I put them in an airtight container for storage. If you don't have one, keep them in a ziplock. If you leave them exposed to air, the tea will taste stale after a few weeks.

review/text: LL is a great cleanser but be aware that when it goes to work you should be near a facility. I find it a bit harsh and prefer Mirolax which is tasteless and has a much milder effect...at least for me. However, the first time I used LL, I lost 5 pounds in 3 days. Everyone is different so don't take that as &#34;your&#34; baseline. Can't hurt to try. I usually mix it with a flavored tea (berry, peach, orange etc.) as the taste alone leaves a bit to be desired for my pallet.

review/text: I'm sooo happy I found this tea on Amazon.com. The price for 60 bags is unbelievable at best. I have always purchased this tea with 30 tea bags for 8.99 from a local merchant in my neighborhood. In an attempt save more of my hard earned money, I began checking prices of my favorite things elsewhere and low and behold I found my tea on Amazon.com. I now get 30 more bags (a total of 60) for about 3.00 more. I have a good mind to stand outside of his store and advise the patrons to check Amazon for any products he sells. I've already found several at much cheaper prices on Amazon. Hell, he probably orders from Amazon and re-sales the product. THANK YOU AMAZON!

Unfortunately, it was even more melted the second time. Igourmet did reimbuse for the one cheese variety that melted... I was still stuck cleaning up the mess of melted cheese on the other two warm varieties. Perhaps not a good idea for anyone in a hot climate... especially if your ordering for a special occasion.

review/summary: Not discontinued!
review/text: Despite the many comments online that Tuna Tetrazzini is gone the truth is it's not discontinued, it's simply harder to find. Go to your bigger chain grocers (my Ralph's always has it in stock and frequently has 10/$10 sales) or Super Wal-Mart. Basically any store that normally has a wide selection of Helper flavors. Your smaller grocery chains, Target, Walgreens, etc will not have it. They onlywant to carry the Creamy Pasta and Creamy Broccoli varieties for some reason. Why this is the case makes no sense. When I was growing up tetrazzini was the favorite flavor in our house and you could always find it at the store. Betty Crocker has been making some baffling changes to the Helper line like refusing to put microwave directions on the box (check online if you need them), making flavors harder to find, and reducing the amount of noodles in certain varieties. If you really can't find Tetrazzini, go with Tuna Melt, the other good TH flavor. The others are just not good.

That's only 3 months! And I bought a case, so that was 6 boxes! I did not notice this until this month, so now I feel like I need to use them all up very soon! When you buy this product in a grocery store, you usually have at least an entire year before the "best if used by" date! I will not buy a case of anything through Amazon again, unless it is something I don't have to worry about the expiration date.

review/summary: Tuna Tetrazzini
review/text: This product, in my opinion, is the best of the Tuna Helper flavors. Its flavor is bright, not muddy or overly thick and the noodles hold their texture. I add a little parmesian cheese to it. Can't find it in any of the stores in Tucson, Arizona.

review/summary: The Best of the Tuna Helpers
review/text: All the Tuna Helpers are excellent, but the Tetrazzini is the best in my view. Oddly, the one package I used of my shipment from Amazon did not have the extraordinary flavor of the one I purchased in our local store. Since my original purchase, my local store does not carry the Tetrazzini Tuna Helper. I am willing to accept that the one package I purchased from Amazon was not a true sample of the excellent Tetrazzini put out under the Tuna Helper label. Since the product is, I assume, made the same way each time, I expect the balance of the boxes I purchased to exhibit the same flavor as the first box I purchased from my local store.

review/summary: Best Salt You Can Buy
review/text: This is hands down the best sea salt you can buy. Besides the taste, it does not have anything added to prevent clogging. Since these additives are often derived from corn, this is important to people with corn sensitivities. Despite the lack of any anti-clogging agent, the salt flows easily from the shaker. I keep a small size bottle in my purse for meals out.

If you're accustomed to ramens that are loaded with tons of sodium, then you might find it less flavorful than what you are used to. If you can get past the lack of sodium, you'll be able to taste subtler flavors.

I bought a three cases of these because Nissin Choice ramen was discontinued at the supermarket and I wanted something a little more healthy because I eat ramen for breakfast often.I told my four coworkers I was going to throw out all the ramen and they all tried a packet. They all agreed it was the worst ramen they had ever tasted by far and wouldn't take it for free. I think I am going to donate it to the food bank, pity the homeless.

Top ranking as a Certified Organic, it is a light, sophisticated, unexpected, very fine tea. Try it, and I think you will appreciate the unique twist in adding bergamot to a green leaf brew. I use this tea as an aperitif, or late in the evening in place of a sweet to finish my day peacefully, savoring an unusually pleasing and calming teapot experience. Night after night, I never get tired of it. Ahhhh.....Have fun~ enjoy!

Other salt always gives me endema and raises my blood pressure. RealSalt does not give me endema as do other salts, and my blood pressure has even gone down rather than up. My whole family feels better. We will never use other salts again. We just finished using our first 25 # box, and love it. By the way, we have found that it pours better than other salts, too.

review/text: If the taste of nu-salt was any closer to salt, it would be salt. I have tried them all and this is way better than than the best of all the others. Especially when you're having that special something that just isn't right without salt.......ta da. MY neighbor (who is also reducing her sodium intake) had the same disappointing results from the others, and after tasting Nu-salt wanted me to order some for her on my next Amazon shopping trip.

review/summary: Tastes just like table salt - No aftertaste
review/text: This product tastes exactly like iodized salt. NO aftertaste like other salt substitutes. My mother is a diabetic who also has CHF and must take diuretics for fluid retention. This product was given to her during a hospital rehabilitation stay in Missouri and we searched high and low for it in Georgia but it is not carried in any stores. The price is great and it tastes fantastic. I use it in my salt shaker at home now and no one knows the difference.

review/summary: disgusting, but can be used as "filler" or to spike your existing salt
review/text: I gave the product itself a 3 star review because it is exactly what it claims it is, 100% potassium chloride - it comes reasonably boxed and the shaker is just... well its a shaker and it works.HOWEVERThis is NOT a perfectly acceptable salt replacement as it is, not in a longshot. The "metallic taste" is an understatement.This tastes absolutely nothing like salt to me, not even a little. What I taste reminds me of when I am using grinding wheels in the workshop and get the metal dust in my mouth... Not even salty metal dust. The metallic taste IS the taste, and it's aweful.You can use this to spike regular salt as filler, maybe up to 50/50 but probably less... but do not expect to purchase this as something you can just get used to or as something that will be "good enough"This is a great value oz to oz on amazon at it's current selling price, but plan on using it with other ingredients. I needed to increase my potassium intake on a ketosis diet so this worked as way to sneak some in and it is much cheaper than pills.

review/summary: Not great, but I'll work with it.
review/text: I'm hoping this tastes better over time. There is definitely a metallic aftertaste. It is strong. Like "maybe I just ingested something I shouldn't have" strong. The effect is lessened when combined with other spices. I used a no salt blend (Kirkland brand) and added Nu Salt to give the blend a little more salty flavor. It worked OK, but not as tasty as I had hoped. I'll likely try out other similar products. If they all taste like this, then I'll just use it sparingly with heavy doses of other spices. It is definitely worth it to try to find tasty lower sodium options. Salt kills.

review/text: I bought it for my father who just came out of rehab after stroke. Doctor told us to eliminate solt from his diet as much as we can. So I ordered Nu-Salt. This product does not even taste like salt, it tastes like an iron, very strange and unpleasant taste. People, please DO NOT buy a whole 12 pack before you taste it. I'm actually pretty amazed that people leave good feedbacks for this product which is in my case totally oposite. Try to use lemon, lime or maybe different type of salt replacement but not Nu-Salt.

review/summary: Great for a potassium deficient diet.
review/text: I have been tracking my eating for health and weight loss reasons. One thing I have found is that I am critically lacking in potassium to the point that I have had severe physical manifestations of potassium deficiency. I have started to change my diet but I can't get enough potassium in my diet and feel ok with the food I eat (I have Gulf War syndrome and many things my stomach does not like). I tried supplements but I don't want to waste the money on it when I can add this to my food and lower my sodium while increasing my potassium at the same time. I know this is not the main reason people start using potassium salt but this is my reason and I feel a lot better since doing it. I humbly suggest others find a food tracker like fitday or caloriecount to see what they are deficient in. Many of the issues with me are directly related to potassium deficiency.

review/text: Due to heart issues I am on a low sodium diet and also take multiple diuretics that cause me to have trouble keeping my potassium levels up in the optimal range. I have been through all the various brands of salt substitutes I can find, and Nu-Salt is one of a couple that I find has the least amount of bitterness. Using Nu-Salt I have managed to adjust my recipes to work well and have also managed to make sodium free variatiions of my favorite seasonings and rubs, including seasoned salt.The packaging of the bulk pack of 12 is also very convenient. it comes in the same display box you might find on store shelves, so it keeps them neatly contained in my otherwise messy pantry.

review/text: I bought this at the health food store, and I guess I could get used to the bitter aftertaste that, as one other reviewer says, ends up in your throat, but I should have read the ingredients more closely. Even if I liked the taste, I couldn't use it because of that last ingredient "natural flavor". Not sure if you're aware, but that's one of the many aliases of Mono-sodium Glutamate, as in "Accent", and is a flavor enhancer. Many people have no known sensitivities to MSG, but I'm a lifelong migraine sufferer and have to keep an eye out for it because it's poison to my system.

review/text: I have no idea who is submitting the 5* reviews here, but they lost their taste buds years ago.This stuff tastes nothing like salt. It has a horrible bitter after-taste that lingers in your mouth ruining anything it touches.Try it at a restaurant or something before buying it. It even nauseates in cooking or in recipes requiring any significant amount of salt.If you are on a salt free diet, find something else. Yuk! With a capital Yuk!!=============UPDATE=====================I have found one use for this. In cooking, with tomato sauce, if you mix it with real salt, you need much less salt. The tomato sauce appears to nullify the bitterness somehow. So, if you like pasta with sauce but have to cut down on salt intake, perhaps this is the answer for that.But it is NO salt shaker for the table.

Potassium chloride may be harmful to an unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Serious side effects of potassium include uneven heartbeat, muscle weakness or limp feeling, severe stomach pain, and numbness or tingling in your hands, feet, or mouth.In addition to all this scary information...product tastes horrible.

review/summary: 150 parts KCl + 1 part Citric Acid = a good NaCl substitute
review/text: This Nu-Salt product is almost entirely potassium chloride (KCl) rather than table salt, which is sodium chloride (NaCl). Potassium chloride tastes more like table salt than anything else I've tried, but it does have a bit of a metallic after taste. I've fairly-well masked that, though, by mixing 150 parts of potassium chloride with one part of citric acid crystals (also called sour salt). Citric acid has a very strong lemon flavor which is so strong by itself that it's difficult to use a small enough quantity of it. By mixing a small amount of it with potassium chloride, the citric acid flavor is much diluted, which makes it much easier to use, and the potassium chloride metallic after taste essentially disappears.EDIT: I keep changing the ratio of KCl to citric acid. Now I appear to have settled on about 1/4 of a teaspoon of citric acid per 3 oz. shaker of Nu-Salt. I think that works out to about 72 parts KCl to one part citric acid. It's all a matter of your taste, obviously.

review/summary: A tasty, considerably healthier substitute
review/text: I'm the kind of guy who has great blood pressure and no real medical conditions -- and I'd like to keep it that way. I recently started the Atkins Nutritional Approach and I'm having great success. However, as a side effect to eating healthier, the salt (and sugar, for that matter) found in most prepared foods is becoming hard to swallow -- most places simply use too much.I purchased this at a local store on a whim to see if I can balance my home cooking with the high-sodium foods found outside of my home. I never tried it before because I know a lot of people have an unpleasant reaction to it, such as a bitter or metallic taste. I'm happy to say it tastes great to me. It has the same "buzz" or "bite" as salt does, you don't need to use quite as much to get the same saltiness in foods as with Sodium-Chloride, and I experience no aftertaste or metallic/bitter flavor. It also seems to bring out accompanying flavors, such as garlic, just as well as real salt does.The only slight problem, and the reason why I give it 4 stars instead of 5, is that it doesn't have an after-taste but an "after-effect". I get a very slight feeling of tightness in my throat, like when you salivate before vomiting. It sounds a lot worse than it is, because it's a very mild effect. Salt actually does the same thing to the palate, but not as strongly as Potassium-Chloride does; for me, at least.Overall an excellent substitute for a more healthy lifestyle that just takes a little "getting used to".

review/summary: Love it for its unintended use
review/text: Which is for the potassium, itself. I've never used it as a salt substitute, however, although judging by the taste, you probably won't be thrilled with it unless you have a strict sodium-intake dietary restriction.This stuff is just incredible in the amount of potassium it packs in such a small amount. 1/6 teaspoon will give you a whopping 530mg of potassium. Because, by law, in the US, supplements are limited to 99mg per tablet, I didn't feel like spending all that money for pills and downing a bunch of them throughout the day (3500mg being the RDA, for potassium). I have current restriction on my food intake that make it impossible to receive the RDA of Potassium the natural way, so I needed to find a different way to get it in my system. The supplements you would otherwise have to purchase (unless you had a prescription for a higher grade from your doctor) are capped at that amount (99mg) for specific reasons that you should check out on the wikipedia entry for "potassium", if you want to be sure you'll be OK. I only take the 1/6 teaspoon at a time-4 x's a day-just to be on the safe side. I wouldn't recommend taking the whole daily allowance at one time. You'll be asking for trouble that way. I have serious cramps in both legs at times, and while I'm unable to prevent them while I'm sleeping, as soon as I feel the crap coming on, I rush to the NuSalt, place a bit under my tongue to get it in my system immediately and then dilute the rest in water and drink it. Cramp and soreness gone. Same goes with cramps after running. The Potassium works almost instantly. An inexpensive way to supplement with potassium for those who require it. Great product. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Warning - Low Salt Substitutes are NOT always a Safe substitute for Table Salt
review/text: Nu-Salt is not necessarily a safe substitute for table salt and anyone considering using it should FIRST consult with their physician. Nu-Salt, in fact, could make matters worse for some people on a salt restricted diet! Nu-Salt substitutes one salt for another salt. Table salt is sodium chloride and Nu-Salt substitutes that for potassium chloride.Now here is what the Cleveland Clinic says about this type of product (Mayo and Cleveland are generally considered the top two health organizations in the USA): "Salt substitutes are NOT a healthful option for EVERYONE. Many salt substitutes contain potassium chloride in place of sodium chloride. Potassium consumed in excess may be harmful for some people ... a salt substitute containing potassium chloride is an acceptable alternative in moderation, if you do NOT HAVE kidney problems and have checked with your physician to be sure it will not interact with any of your medications"Additional research found statements like this: "salt substitutes are low-sodium alternatives designed to taste similar. They usually contain mostly potassium chloride, whose toxicity is approximately equal to that of table salt in a healthy person ....However, various diseases and medications may decrease the body's excretion of potassium, thereby increasing the risk of potentially FATAL hyperkalemia. People with kidney failure, heart failure or diabetes should NOT use salt substitutes without medical advice. A manufacturer, Lo Salt, has issued an advisory statement"Note the reference to kidney problems, diabetes and heart failure - the three groups of people most likely to be in need of reducing their salt intake. The likelihood that this product will interact with some typical blood pressure medications is fairly high. The warning about this product possibly interacting with medications should NOT be ignored.I'll conclude with a direct quote from the Nu-Salt web site: "Please consult with your physician before using Nu-Salt."I would NOT recommend this product unless you have consulted with your physician first! It clearly takes a physician or other health care professional to decide whether this is a suitable alternative to table salt on an individual basis.

review/summary: Best of the salt substitutes
review/text: I've found Nu-Salt to be a near perfect sodium substitute. The taste is not identical to table salt but it's as close as I've found. In low/moderate quantities I seriously doubt I could tell the difference. It is a simple potassium salt, actually providing 530mg (15% DV) of potassium per serving - more than a banana. So not only are you eliminating sodium, you're also getting potassium, which lowers blood pressure (search, "potassium blood pressure"). Americans consume less than half the RDA of potassium, but by all means, if you are concerned, ask your Dr.IMO, this is as good as it gets. I like it.

review/summary: better value than No Salt, and more convenient
review/text: How often can you say that a product is a better value in a SMALLER package than in a large one? Well, at $16.20 for a 12-pack of 3 oz shakers (that's about $5.40 for 12 oz of product) this product is cheaper than No Salt's larger 11 oz size for $5.75 and up. Plus, I agree with my fellow reviewers: the smaller size is more convenient for travel and dining out. The shakers close tight and can be snuck into a restaurant (or a relative's home at the holidays...!) stuffed in a pocket for use at the table. I highly recommend this product for anyone on a salt-free or low-sodium diet.

review/summary: A credible substitute for salt on selected food
review/text: Nu-Salt, which substitutes potassium for sodium, is a very satisfactory substitute for salt on many foods, but its particular use will depend on your taste. I've followed a low sodium diet for years and generally enjoy all my food without salt, even in cooking. There are a few foods, however, that cry for a salty tang: oven-fried potatoes, no-salt-added cottage cheese, salt-free vegetable juice. Judicious use of Nu-Salt really adds to these foods. I don't use it on vegetables or in baking. Family members enjoy it on different foods, but we all like it.The flavor of Nu-Salt is salty with a touch of bitterness, not that different from salt. Try it in small amounts on several foods to make your own decision. The oven-fries are great!If you're on medication or under a doctor's care, it's important that you don't use salt substitutes without checking. Very important.All in all, I think Nu-Salt is a fine product.

review/text: A good tea at a bulk price. It tastes good and I got enough that I can drink it fairly often without spending a lot of cash, what more can I say?You have to be careful with this tea, overbrewing will make it very bitter. I normally leave my tea in longer than recommended because I like stronger flavor, but this was a little much even for me. After about 6 minutes it starts to taste like coffee...It tastes great, but its not terribly fragrant, which is half of the appeal for me. My coworkers can always tell when I have my Earl Grey, but this just smells like mild vanilla. The string on the bag is not the strongest, and several times has pulled off the bag, leaving the bag to sink to the bottom of my vacuum flask.All in all, I'd buy it again but this might not be what I serve guests.

review/summary: The heat lingers
review/text: Based on the other two reviews I was expecting more of a classic sweet and savory experience. My experience with these was that the spice overwhelms the sweet, while the salty is almost too faint to notice. The heat from the chili spice lasts way too long for a product advertising itself as sweet and savory. These really are more of a spiced nut than sweet and savory. If you like heat with a trail that lasts for minutes, this is your product. If you don't, try something else.

review/summary: I actually sought out this seller again because of the results I had with first purchase
review/text: I tracked down my invoice from a year ago so I could find this seller again, and when I found them was surprised to see the negative reviews. I bought 25 lbs in Sept. 2010 and due to personal circumstances was not able to start growing any wheatgrass until this summer. I just did two trays, with 2 cups of seed per tray, soaked and then germinated for 3 days in the dark. I had good thick trays of grass, and most importantly it was so deliciously sweet! This was my first time growing wheat grass and it smelled so strong and bitter when I juiced it-- I was concerned, thinking it would taste awful. But it was so sweet to the taste. I was later told by an old pro that some say the sweetness is due to the seed, which brings me back to why I sought out this seller again. Obviously, I can't be guaranteed that the next 25 lbs will be equally sweet since it's a year later and likely a different harvest, but I hope so!

review/text: I'm usually one to get bored with something and move on to new things. However, I have been drinking this tea for years (I'm still drinking it in 2010, 3 years after my initial 2007 review!!). It doesn't get bitter, unlike many other teas, no matter how long you steep it. It is balanced, sweet, and smooth all on it's own--no need for extra sugar or honey to make this a great, refreshing tea.

review/summary: A Disappointment!
review/text: I had thought this would be full of dried fruits and nuts ( in other words, healthful) but it's really just sugar laddened bits of hard fruits and only flavorless peanut pieces. I have given the local food bank all but the one package I opened which made me feel so unwell that it's now in the rubbish. I am truly very disappointed in this product. It's description belies it's reality. If sugar is contraindicated in your diet....steer clear of this product!! It's low in salt and low in fat but so over sugared as to be actually nauseating. It's too bad because it sounded delicious and so nutritious. All I can say is YUK!!! I suggest you leave this product alone unless you think high sugar is good for you.

review/summary: All the flavors of the farmer's market...if your farmer harvests only sugar...
review/text: These types of fruit mixes live or die on the basis of how well the flavors in the package complement one another. The best of these kinds of things mix sweet fruit with sour or salty or chocolate or something else.Not this one. It's just cloyingly sweet on top of cloyingly sweet. There are several types of dried fruit in the bag, but there's so much added suger they all taste the same. Basically, everything is a little sweeter than normal raisins. This may appeal to the kids in your house, but the adults will want to approach this stuff with caution. You might be able to make this stuff edible by mixing it yourself with other (less sweet) things, but taken as-is you'll probably consider this mix to be almost inedible in anything but modest amounts.

Neither spice (chili/lemon) is overpowering, they complement each other resulting in an addicting and healthy snack. If you like tex mex blends, you have to try this...it is sooooo much better!!

review/text: When you read the (Klassic 3 Seed) ingredients, you can't dispute that this cracker is probably healthy.... but only if you can get it down. This has got to be one of the hardest, tasteless things I've ever eaten. I even tried this with different spreads. Eating healthy does not mean you have to sacrafice taste. I don't know who wrote the first couple of reviews but I'm convinced they must be associated with the manufacturer. Do yourself a favor... keep shopping. There are many other good tasting and good for you things out there to spend your money on. Hope my honestly helped.

review/summary: Great crunch, great taste, natural ingredients. A winner
review/text: We got introduced to Doctor Kracker a couple of years ago when my wife found them at Fresh Market. We all love them and have bought them in plastic containers since we first discovered them. It's a guilt-free snack that the whole family can agree on. Our three kids (9, 8, and 8) all love them. The crunch is incredible, I don't think I've ever had a cracker with more impressive crunchy texture. The flavor is muted, not extravagant or overwhelming. Just simple goodness. We get this Klassic 3 Seed, and we also get the Sunflower/Cheddar and the Seedlander. Now that they are being packaged in individual servings, they are great for school lunches and handy for packing to work or anywhere else. We use Subscribe & Save on Amazon to keep these babies in stock all the time. They are also great for dips, because they are so stout you don't have to worry about them breaking off in the dip, and they are way healthier than most other chips I see laid out with dips at parties.(I also highly suggest Stacy's Pita Chips for another great, healthy, crunchy accompaniment.)

review/summary: Dr. Kracker Klassic 3 Seed snack
review/text: These crackers truly have it all: they're healthy, organic, high in fiber, low in carbs, no added fats or oils, no trans-fatty acids. They're baked with valuable oil seeds and Omega 3 fatty acids along with whole grains and extra seed fiber.They're unbelievably crunchy and satisfying and the 1-ounce pouch provides just enough for a snack because if you bought the large container you would be left with an empty container.For once I found a snack that I believe will appeal to everybody. Try them for yourself and see if I'm not telling the truth then pass the rave review on to your friends and family.

review/text: I am trying to make healthier choices so I tried these. Hm-m-m-mThese crackers are very dry. They do have a subtle, interesting flavor but I find them impossible to chew and swallow without adding margarine, peanut butter or something. Sort of defeats the healthier thing I'm tryng to do.Therefore I rate them so-so.They do add something to my tomato soup if I break them over the top.

review/summary: Very healthy but the flavor isn't great
review/text: I ordered these and got tired of them quick. I love healthy snacks but these lacked flavor and were almost too hard and crunchy to chew. I ate them with hummus which was ok, but when I tried to eat them plain, I couldn't even get through one little pouch. Great concept but needs more spices to make them tastier and more flavorful. I am dissapointed that I wasted my money because I still have almost all of the packages sitting in my cupboard and I probably won't eat them. My dog likes them though, so maybe they will become his treats for awhile so I don't feel guilty about throwing them away.

review/summary: Pumpkin pie heaven!!
review/text: I love anything and everything pumpkin, whether sweet or savory it brings a smile to my fave and makes me feel warm, cozy and happy. Maybe that's why Halloween is my favorite holiday and I start celebrating it in September! Since pumpkin pie is my favorite dessert I ordered these Pumpkin Gingerlies simply because I have never had a pumpkin flavored cookie before. The beauty of the Immaculate Baking Co. is the deep flavor each tiny cookie has. Each little treat is about two bites and is satisfying and flavorful, I don't feel the need to eat a huge cookie when I can have one or two of these guys and feel my sugar cravings bite the dust!What hit me first was the spicy, tropical ginger, then the mellow buttery pumpkin, it really tastes like a mini pumpkin pie, crust and all. The flavor combination was superb, from peppery and zingy it melted into luscious, creamy milky pumpkin. These cookies are packaged in 2oz. bags that are easy to throw in my purse and take with me wherever the road leads that day. Each baggie is only 130 calories and these are so rich and delicious I feel like I am eating a whole pie and at times can't even finish the little bag. I love knowing they are all natural with no trans fats and the brand is not only eye catching but worth the consumer's time.For those who like their life a little sweet, a little spicy and definitely tasty this is the cookie for them! These were a lovely surprise but since trying few other flavors from Immaculate Baking Co I do not get surprised anymore, I know their cookies will taste great and I am never disappointed.- Kasia S.

review/summary: It doesn't get much better than this ...
review/text: This is yet another new favorite! I've tried several varieties of Immaculate Baking Company's cookies, and every time I try a new one, it becomes my "favorite"! This one is no different. It tastes like a "pumpkin pie" in cookie form, with a bit more "kick" than your typical pumpkin pie filling. I love the 2-oz snack bags -- otherwise, I'd be really pigging out on these. I just toss one in my book bag on my way out the door in the morning for a quick snack between classes (I'm a full-time student).Really, these are unusually good, high quality cookies. At about $.80 per pack, they're a good deal. As long as Amazon keeps stocking them, I'll keep buying them.

review/text: The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that it's an odd texture for me. It's kind of caught between being a hard and a soft cookie. It tastes great!! I love the blend of ginger and pumpkin. Sometimes, I'll bite into a small bit of a cookie that's got more ginger than others, but it's all good. Truly, the taste is wonderful, and getting 16 little bags of the morsels? Great snack bags to take to work or on the bus.

If you're a sailor from the eighteenth to ninteenth century and you're used to "ship's biscuit", then I'm sure you will love these as they've got more protein and better taste, and are also in nice sealed packages (no weavils!) They remind me of Woody Allen's line, "I could make a lot of money selling these in a health food store."I went for these because of all the rave reviews, and I am now dissapointed. I guess I can feed these to my boyfriend... he might eat them if he's really hungry and there's nothing else.

review/text: Doctor Kracker offers several varieties of crackers, but "Sedlander" is my favorite. It has organic pumpkin seeds, organic poppy seeds, organic sesame seeds and many other organic seeds. They are made with organic whole grain spelt flour. The small bag has 5 grams of protein and 3 grams of dietary fiber. This is a great substitute for unhealthy 'other' crunchie snacks. The case package of 24 one ounce bags makes the puchase very economical, especially with free shipping.

review/summary: The Real McCoy Mustard Sauce is VERY tasty......and unlike any sauce I can buy in NY.
review/text: I discovered this sauce when I went to Charleston, WV to see a pharmacy school with my son. It doesn't taste like any sauce I can get in Syracuse, NY. It's mustard based which I'm partial to. I used it to make home made chicken tenders.....I dipped the chicken in the the mustard sauce and rolled in panko crumbs...it's delicious. I hope Amazon gets this sauce in stock!

review/summary: This tea is wonderful!!!
review/text: I first tried this tea after dinner at a restaurant in Napa and was instantly hooked. It is wonderfully fragrant and delicious and I'm not typically a big tea drinker. The only place I've been able to find it was a Dean and Deluca in Napa - quite a drive from San Jose just for tea. I'm thrilled to see it available on Amazon!!

review/summary: So good they're dangerous!
review/text: Man, you could just sit there behind a computer and much away a whole tin of these over the course of a few hours, and that's a lot of fat! So, these are so good I'd say that if you're trying to lose weight I'd stay away unless your doing about 5 miles a day on a treadmill, and then you'd still better have some discipline and just put...the...tin...away after a while. Man these are good!

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I've never asked Amazon for a refund. This was a first. I read the reviews. All gave high ratings. My experience differs. Yes, the cashews are jumbo, in fact they're huge. However, they lacked flavor and many had a harder, more brittle texture then I'm use too. Oh well back to Planters.

review/summary: Not worth the price
review/text: I purchased this tin of cashews knowing it was 3.8 times the price of Planters cashews(per ounce). I was expecting a big richer taste and they were anything but. I don't understand the price because there's no reason to go back and buy more being that close to the industrial grade Planters in taste. I bought them for my wife and she said simply, "don't do that again".

Can't go wrong with them. I didn't rate 5 stars because, afterall, it's just a cashew! - but they are good ones.

review/text: They were great, my groom is a huge cashew fan as is my mom and both were more than pleased. They are not heavily salted at all, we were pleasantly surprised, the salt is more of a fine powder than what you would expect from a salted product. They always live upto having the best peanuts in VA, we send them to people all over the country and they are all hooked!

review/summary: More than "just water"
review/text: A little less than 5 years ago, I traveled through Romania and Moldova. Of all the things that I fell in love with (and became a necessity during my trip), the different brands and locations of bottled water was one of them. After all, the region boasts a number of famous spas and springs. Anyway, this particular water is a little more salty tasting than other carbonated mineral waters, but is really enjoyable, smooth, and worth trying. Personally, I prefer it to some of the other more easily found sparkling waters that taste a little harsh and bland.

review/summary: The Real McCoy Mustard Sauce is VERY tasty......and unlike any sauce I can buy in NY.
review/text: I discovered this sauce when I went to Charleston, WV to see a pharmacy school with my son. It doesn't taste like any sauce I can get in Syracuse, NY. It's mustard based which I'm partial to. I used it to make home made chicken tenders.....I dipped the chicken in the the mustard sauce and rolled in panko crumbs...it's delicious. I hope Amazon gets this sauce in stock!

review/text: So, I placed my order Oct.30. They arrived in my mailbox 10 days later,very appropriately wrapped and in good health. I was very surprised to find that they came directly from Thailand to my home in Florida. Whenever I travel overseas I like to sneak cutting or seeds in my suitcase and worry about getting caught by immigration who hate for us to import vegetation. Apparently customs passed the lemongrass without any problems!!! Yeah!!Anyway, as soon as they arrived I unpacked the 8 stalks and stuck them in water. Today is 5 days later and all of the stalks have started to sprout!!!!I am so thrilled with this and look forward to seeing the fresh leaves pop out from the top. I plan to plant these so I can enjoy a lifetime of this wonderful fresh, therapeutic herb. Thanks Franz Market for a job well done and for making me a happy little camper :) GOD BLESS!

review/summary: Not equal to Senseo Coffee by any measure...
review/text: I had high hopes for the Gala Brand, however now after trying the Dark Roast and the Mocha I find both to be just average coffee and no competition for the Senseo or even the Archer Farms which I find the best for the Senseo Machine.The coffee is a bit burnt in the roast and brews up weak in comparison to the other brands, do not try to get 12oz from any of these pods, the liquid will run clear after 6oz per pod.Price is great if you like weak coffee or using twice the pods for your travel mug in the morning...As the old adage goes, you get what you pay for, and even though from Holland these are not re-packaged Senseo pods as some lead to believe!

review/summary: too strong & bitter
review/text: I purchased this based on the good reviews I read from others. I like a nice strong cup of coffee, but after drinking this I am now aware that there is a whole other level to "strong coffee"! I know this may not sound too pleasant, but the only way I can describe the flavor is that it taste like the bottom of an ashtray. No, I've never tasted an ashtray! But if one could imagine what an ashtray taste like, it would be this coffee. I know all those who gave this rave reviews probably want to shoot me, but I think it is only fair that anyone contemplating this magic extra bold coffee, needs to be prepared for possible disappointment. Since we had a whole box to use up, we tried making it several ways - larger cup size, to help weaken it, flavors, extra cream & sugar...no matter what we did, we could not get that bitter flavor off our tongues! :(

review/summary: This brew is an eye-opener
review/text: I usually save this K-cup for those mornings when I drag myself to work half-asleep. It's full-bodied, extra bold in flavor, yet not bitter, and is perfect with a little chocolate syrup or chocolate stevia mixed in. And the end result is I'm wide awake after just one cup of this fabulous flavor.

review/summary: Very Good, But Not the "Kick" I'm Looking For
review/text: There's no doubt that Green Mountain's Dark Magic K-cups make extremely good cups of coffee. It's just that I don't think it packs that much of a punch. The finest espresso K-cup I've tried so far is GM's Espresso Blend. I like my extra dark coffee to have a little bitterness to it. That quality makes me know that it's strong, and Espresso Blend has it. Dark Magic is lacking that "something extra." I think the word "sweet" in the product description is the culprit here. Either way, I'd still recommend these to anybody, but Espresso Blend is the best espresso-like coffee to date.(Note: I have 3 varieties that I've never tried coming in the mail: Black Tiger, Double Black Diamond, and Revv. It's highly possible that one of those could unseat Espresso Blend. Can't wait to find out!)

review/summary: Finally A Good Store Brought Rub
review/text: This is so good I actually brought several bottles to always have on hand. I have tried others that were ok, but not great. Either they were too salty, peppery, or too much of the ole brown sugar, and nothing in between. I made countless rubs at home that were ok, but not like KC. If I could find out the exact proportions via the Internet I would make up a huge batch.I have used this rub on chicken, pork, fish and shrimp and it is wonderful. It is not in your face over powering if you get heavy handed applying the rub. I brought one rub, put it on, and after I cooked the meat, I had to literally wash off the rub.Some rubs work well with say chicken, but not fish.The slight golden color makes the food look appetizing. I have made rubs that turned dark brown, red, and even black, not exactly eye candy.I like to grill and smoke and this takes all the hassle and guess work out of what rub to use on what.My wife isn't keen on rubs, but this one she likes.

review/text: I use this on all meats (beef, pork, turkey, chicken, etc.) when I'm grilling and not using BBQ sauce.I rub it on the raw meat just before putting it on the grill.It also has much less salt than other similar grilling seasonings, but is better tasting than the ones with no salt.I recommend it for both indoor and outdoor grilling. I think it would work well for baking also, but I have not tried that way yet.My wife and I have tried several different types of seasonings (including higher priced ones found in small specialty stores that make their own in small batches), but we keep coming back to this one because it has the best flavor.I highly recommend it. We now buy it on Amazon because we can't find it in stores.

review/text: That's what my mother said, and she doesn't even like strong coffee! We got her a Keurig machine for Christmas, and so far have had fun trying the various K-Cups. Mom is leaning towards Wake-Up Call as an everyday coffee, and my wife and I (who drink Jeremiah's Pick Fogbuster or Longbottom Black Gold as our morning cup) think that's good, too. So, to keep this short, Nantucket Blend doesn't taste bad, it just doesn't have much flavor. If you like your coffee very mild/weak, you might love it. If you like stronger, bolder, darker blends, forget about it.

review/summary: Tastes the way coffee should taste
review/text: This was the first coffee I sampled from my Keurig coffee maker. The flavor is nutty and mild without the acidity of many drip coffees. I am not a fan of the bold, strong coffees and prefer the milder blends. This is a great early morning coffee to enjoy with your breakfast. While you can order it on Amazon, I've found it for a better price on another website provided I buy 4 boxes of 25 K cups at a time. However, I can mix and match other flavors and brands to get the 4 boxes.I like flavored coffee as well so in addition to the Nantucket, I also recommend the Southern Pecan and Wild Blueberry. I like to brew a cup of the blueberry just to make the room smell like blueberry cobbler. Also check out Gloria Jeans K-Cups, French Vanilla, 25-Count Box (Pack of 2) if you like flavored coffee.

review/text: Well it's not a bad cup of coffee, it just isn't very interesting. It is reasonably smooth, low acid, slightly nutty, very slightly bitter, low on oils, slightly plasticy (which all of the K-cups are). It reminds me of a weaker version of Dunkin coffee, and that's on the second to smallest setting on the Keurig, anything larger and it's tea. I haven't found my favorite K-cup yet, but the search is half the fun.

review/summary: One of My Favorites
review/text: It's interesting how different people perceive coffee. Some here thought it was watery and tasteless, while others love it. As for me, it has a nice taste, somewhat mild, and not bitter at all. It diesn't leave an aftertaste as some do and isn't over-powering. This is my choice to drink alone without any food. I think cookies or biscuits or whatever would over power it. When I have my coffe with food I choose a stronger roast. So for a late morning or mid afternoon cup, or a cup at my desk, this is just right. For breakfast something stronger would be better.All that said, I can almost always find these K cups much cheaper at my local stores than at Amazon.

review/text: I wouldn't consider myself a coffee connoisseur, but I do know what I like and this is not it. I found this coffee weak and watery. I ran it in the smallest cup size that my machine makes and it was still weak.I will admit that the flavor wasn't bad, but there just wasn't enough of it. It tasted like I got a half packed cup. This was one that came as a sample with my Keurig system. I normally prefer French Roast, Sumatran Reserve, Dark Magic - you know something with a kick. But even the Breakfast Blend that I purchased had more flavor. Suffice to say this should be very low on your list if you want something that has a reasonable volume of flavor.

review/summary: Very dark and rich.
review/text: Great blend, if you like French Roasts you will love this. I have found the best K-cups for the Keurig are the dark roasts, they seem to brew with the best flavor, and as far as they go this is one of the best. You won't go wrong choosing this if you love a dark, rich, full bodied flavor with a little bite like I do.

review/text: I'm a strong coffee drinker and thought to myself that a French Roast is a bold coffee. Well, I didn't find this to be very "bold" so I can't rate it well according to my taste for coffee.If you like strong coffee like we do - consider these:1. Timothy's Midnight Magic --> BY FAR my favorite!2. Green Mountain Dark Magic3. Emeril's Extra BoldThat being said, some people don't like the strong taste of coffee so take my advice only if you are a strong coffee drinker.

review/summary: Strong and smooth
review/text: I found this to be a pleasantly strong dark coffee; it was rich and smooth without being at all bitter. However, as I tend to prefer my coffee on the milder side, I am not sure that this would appeal to TRUE dark coffee lovers--i.e., what was good for me might not be right for someone looking for something stronger. Overall, however, I would recommend this coffee.

review/summary: Terribly weak
review/text: We love Hazlenut coffee, so we figured that the Gloria Jean version would be great. Boy, were we wrong...... This was the weakest coffee (really slightly tinted brown water) that we have ever tried. After the first K-cup, we tried, the coffee was so weak, I thought that I had done something wrong. And the coffee tasted like hot water. So I made a second cup and watched the coffee as it came out of the Keurig. The last half of the brew was just clear water..... Terrible.So I grabbed a Green Mountain K-Cup and shook it. I could hear the coffee moving around inside and felt the weight compared the Gloria Jean. No comparison, The Gloria Jean was as light as a feather.We packed up the rest of the box and sent it back. I don't know what to make of this. Maybe we got a bad batch.

review/summary: A good cup of coffee after we doctored it up a little!
review/text: This is a good hazelnut coffee with just the right strength for my wife and me. We brewed a medium cup of coffee on the Keurig and the flavor was perfect after we doctored it up with our sweetener and a little cream. It was a medium strength cup of coffee with a hint of hazelnut in the flavor.Without being sweetened and without the cream it was rather harsh, strong and had an aftertaste. It would depend on how you like to prepare your coffee. I couldn't drink it straight but it was more than acceptable after we prepared it. It is a good cup of coffee and if you like hazelnut then you will like this.I posted a photo of the K-Cup.

review/summary: Good Tasting Decaf Coffee - Recommended!
review/text: Timothy's "Colombian Decaffeinated K-Cups" is very good tasting coffee. I like coffee all day long, but need to switch to decaf later in the day. This is a good substitute for my normal type,Coffee People, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging], but not quite as strong tasting.My only observation is that you can get two uses out of these K-Cups if made on the "Small Cup" setting, which serves us just fine since we add a lot of "Half and Half" to our evening coffee.Recommended!CFH

review/summary: An excellent cup of coffee that you will not think is decaf!
review/text: For several years now my wife and I have been drinking decaffeinated coffee. As we got older we need to cut back on caffeine as it began to make us jittery and have a few heart flutters. We found that it was hard to find a really good decaf coffee and many of them have a strange taste or a bitter taste.We were given a Keurig brewer for Christmas as a gift and I have to tell you that this coffee is just excellent. This is really a full bodied and rich coffee that I honestly cannot tell that it is decaf. There is no funny aftertaste or bitterness and my wife and I just love it. We brew the middle sized cup and the flavor was just perfect for us with a full flavor and not too strong.We both recommend it and we certainly will continue to use their coffee as one of our favorites.

review/summary: Chocolate Dream Bites
review/text: These petite sweet treats are dense and the cookie exterior is slightly granular. The overall flavor is a pleasant surprise and tastes a little like Nutella-chocolate with a hint of hazelnut. The chocolate cream center is not nearly as creamy or plentiful as pictured on the packaging, but is present and adds a nice touch to a rather dry cookie.Nutritionally they are high in fat, nearly half of the total calories per serving is exclusively from fat. They also lack any dietary fiber. I'm finding that many of the wheat-free substitutes are low in fiber and I will continue to seek out more healthful wheat-free products.My final thoughts on the matter is that I could probably create some homemade wheat-free cookies that are moister, lower in fat, higher in fiber, and more affordable. I think these cookies make a nice option for weeks where I'm extremely busy and simply don't have the time to bake.

review/text: I have no experience making or eating fresh treacle pudding, but I find the Heinz version to be quite good. It isn't cheap to buy here in the States, but as an occasional treat it's fine. I enjoy the syrup that comes on it, and it really needs to be heated to be good. This definitely isn't on the healthy side, but how many desserts are?

review/summary: Very Pleasantly Sweet and Tasty. A Nice Dessert
review/text: We have a Fresh and Easy Grocery Store not too far from us. It's a British company and has all sorts of imported English items, some at rather reasonable prices. I've been trying a few now and then and some of them are rather impressive. On such item is Heinz Treacle Sponge Pudding. I heat it up in the microwave and serve it with a slight coating of Devon Custard. It's quite good. Very pleasantly sweet and tasty. A nice dessert. My only complaint would be that it has a very high sugar content resulting in a very high calorie count. The pudding is quite delicious, but I'll have to restrain myself as to how often it is served. Such is life.Gary Peterson

review/summary: Bold and fresh tasting
review/text: What happens when you get your Kuerig coffee maker is you get a variety pack of various flavors they have availabe. This was one of the samples that I ordered again, because it is flavorful and fresh tasting, even without cream and coffee, and perfect in a mug on a chilly morning. I don't rate it at five stars because of the price. You can get 25 count boxes for roughly this same price. Also, note the "best if used by" dates that some come stamped on the side of some K-cups. When you see a REALLY good deal at certain places, it is worth calling to ask about the date stamp. I've used K-cups several months past the date stamp and really can't tell any difference, but it is something that makes you wonder whether the stuff really gets stale, or if this is a sales technique applied.

review/text: I thought I remembered Kenya Kilimanjaro being very dark but like another reviewer said, this is not really that dark. It is very good, for a medium roast. I'm not sure if they changed the recipe in the last few years or if my tastes have changed that much.Anyway, this roast is very good, adds a nice base if you like creamer in your coffee, but not a very DARK bitter blend for those who prefer that.

review/summary: Surprisingly good
review/text: I'm a coffee snob. Not the kind of coffee snob who claims to be one but would actually buy a "K-cup brewing system" and expect it to be good. I'm the kind that prefers to brew coffee in an all-glass vacuum pot/syphon with a glass filter rod so the oils don't get absorbed by paper or fabric filters and metal doesn't alter the taste. So I don't usually drink office coffee, because it's usually garbage. Sometimes just for the heat or the caffeine, I'll drink a few cups, though.But back in February I started a new contract, and these guys have one of these K-cup things. Seems like a silly gimmick to me, and a pretty environmentally unfriendly one... but one day I needed some caffeine and started trying the coffees. The first one I tried was a costa rican thing which tasted like someone mixed maxwell house with starbucks and pencil shavings and filtered it through a moderately clean sock. The second one was a columbian one that tasted like maxwell house with less starbucks, more pencil shavings, and a dirty sock. Then someone opened a box of this Kenya stuff, and I rolled my eyes and tried it... and really liked it. It's not the best coffee in the world, but it's very drinkable. Smooth and soft, reasonably rich and robust... it's a nice no-heartburn beverage. I usually toss an ounce of cold water in the bottom of the cup because it doesn't taste so great when it's still at cautious sipping heat, but at a good drinkable temperature it's very doable. Feels like a dark roast without the bitter burned taste, almost like a peaberry. Doubt it's that, but whatever's in it, I'll happily swill down a few cups of it on a day when I want something besides water or tea... not just on days when I need caffeine.

review/summary: Not bad!
review/text: I'm a coffee snob! When I first purchased my Keurig coffee maker I was excited to make my morning cup of coffee so quickly and easily. Unfortunately, what I sacrificed was taste. I've since sampled over a dozen different types of k-cup coffees made for my machine and have yet to find one that makes a truly delicious cup of coffee. I will continue to try all of the recommended brands hoping to find that "ahhhhh" flavor. In the meantime, I use the little filter adaptor that allows me to use my own ground beans in the machine. The Kenya Kilimadjaro k-cup is probably one of the better coffees I've tried so far but the snob in me still only rates it a 3-star taste compared to what I would consider a great cup of coffee.

It's mustard based which I'm partial to. I used it to make home made chicken tenders.....I dipped the chicken in the the mustard sauce and rolled in panko crumbs...it's delicious. I hope Amazon gets this sauce in stock!

It doesn't taste like good coffee and it doesn't taste like French Vanilla. Point blank I couldn't even finish the cup and had to pour it down the drain. The aftertaste is even worse. I don't understand how anyone could give this a positive review but I guess it's all a matter of individual preference.

review/summary: Not the best of the k-cup flavors
review/text: I do love my Keurig coffee machine, and have sampled a wide variety of coffee flavors they offer. This one is NOT one of my favorites. It's acidic, and that overpowers the vanilla and coffee flavors. You can do much better. The two best I've tried so far are Green Mountain Wild Mountain Blueberry and Gloria Jean's Mudslide (chocolatey). If vanilla is your favorite flavor, I would try the Green Mountain or Gloria Jean version, or one of the others.

review/summary: Where's the vanilla and the coffee?
review/text: I love French vanilla coffee and was looking forward to this. It turned out to be a huge disappointment because all I could taste was the milk I put in the coffee.When you read reviews of the Keurig coffee makers, people recommend using bolder, darker roasts. The Van Houtte French Vanilla is a light roast so I obviously knew it wasn't going to be strong. But to be devoid of any flavor is not acceptable. When I made the coffee this morning, I even paused the Keurig during the brew cycle to wet the grounds better in order to produce a more flavorful cup. I also used the 8 oz setting rather than the 10 oz setting on my machine. None of this had any effect. The coffee pouring into my cup was a nice, rich color but there was no coffee or vanilla aroma emanating from it.In this case, I honestly don't understand the positive reviews on this product. I actually like light roasts but this is the first time I've had one that left me wondering where the coffee and the vanilla flavor was.

review/summary: Light flavor and tasted a bit too sweet for me but my wife liked it!
review/text: We tried some of this in our new Keurig coffee maker and it was just OK. This is a lighter brewed cup of coffee with a very sweet taste. It was so sweet that I actually ate a small bit of food with it and it made the coffee taste better to me as it took the sweet edge off of the flavor. I gave it a 4 star rating as my wife loved it but for me it was a 3 or four star.I could drink it without problems but it is not my favorite. It was a smooth flavor and not bitter but the vanilla flavor was a little light. You may have to cut back on any sweetener if you use any. I brewed a medium cup size of coffee. I posted a photo of the K-Cup.

review/text: I had some of the Green Mountain coffee and it was very acidic and way too strong so I wanted something with more flavor and I bought this one. I think it is a great coffee flavor. Those who say it has no flavor obviously are expecting something like a powdery flavored coffee. This isn't too sweet but sweet enough and has a great after taste unlike most coffee which is too acidic. If you are looking for a light roast coffee with a sweet hint of vanilla then get this for sure! can't wait to try other van houtte flavors!

review/summary: One of the best k cups we've tried so far!
review/text: I really enjoy flavored coffees so when we opened the 12 pod sample pack that came with our new Keurig machine, I was excited to find a sample k cup of Van Houtte's French Vanilla. It ended up being one of the best flavors we had an opportunity to try!Van Houtte's French Vanilla is not quite as good as some of the french vanilla coffees I've had fresh brewed at local coffee shops, but it isn't too far off either. It's a very mild, but flavorful coffee with a smooth finish and no bitter aftertaste. I don't like extra dark coffees with lots of acidity, so of that's more your cup of tea, so to speak, this blend isn't for you.I will definitely be picking up more of this blend and if you're in the market for a french vanilla flavored coffee k up for your Keurig brewer, this one is an excellent choice.

review/text: I bought these k-cups at the store to try out in my Keurig single cup coffee maker, they are horrible. Absolutely no french vanilla taste at all, it's not just a weak taste, there is NO TASTE! And to make sure it wasn't just my taste buds, I made several more cups (using 1 k-cup per mug of coffee of course) for family members to see if they could guess what flavor it was, none of them knew and when I told them it was french vanilla, they were of course surprised since you can't taste anything at all.I will never buy Van Houtte again, what a waste of money.

review/text: A sample of these Van Houtte "French Vanilla K-Cups" were included with my Keurig B-40 B40 Elite Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System and it was fairly disappointing to me. This seems to be a "hit-or-miss" flavor since there are so many positive reviews and a scattering of those who, like me, don't like it.When made on the "Large Cup" setting, the French Vanilla flavor was weak and slightly artificial tasting. It isn't really bad or undrinkable, but I will not be buying this flavor in the future.CFH

review/text: I discovered this sauce when I went to Charleston, WV to see a pharmacy school with my son. It doesn't taste like any sauce I can get in Syracuse, NY. It's mustard based which I'm partial to. I used it to make home made chicken tenders.....I dipped the chicken in the the mustard sauce and rolled in panko crumbs...it's delicious. I hope Amazon gets this sauce in stock!

review/summary: Perfectly packaged popcorn for single people
review/text: Say that 10 times fast! It's true though. They really put just enough kernels in the bag to satisfy you without feeling like you should have made 2! I love the Kettle Korn flavor too! If you've never tried it, you don't know what you're missing. It can be very addictive so maybe you better not try. Neah! Go right ahead! It's popcorn - a great healthy snacking alternative to chips, candy, and other junk food.Tip: It says not to use the popcorn button on your microwave which is good advice but if you check that booklet thingy that came with yours (if you can remember which drawer it's buried in) you might find that your popcorn button has multiple size settings like my Samsung model does. All it takes for me is to press the popcorn button 3 times to select "Snack size" and it comes out perfect every time - none burnt or scorched and only a few kernels unpopped.

review/summary: Terrible
review/text: I bought this popcorn without reading the ingredients. I never would have guessed that it would contain artificial sweetener. I made a bag, and soon had a funny aftertaste in my mouth. A familiar aftertaste. Sucralose! Who would expect to find that in a non "diet" popcorn! WHY??? They ruined it. It went in the trash. We don't like the taste of artificial sweeteners and we don't like the fact that one's body doesn't know what to do with them.

review/summary: Great taste, I was surprised it was this yummy!
review/text: The taste of this kettle corn is mildly sweet, not overpowering & not at all artificial-tasting. The product I tried was the 94%-fat-free KETTLE CORN, not to be confused with the Butter. The Kettle Corn has clear white kernals of popped corn, and there is not the first hint of yellow residue anywhere.The best feature: 94% fat-free! Although I am a bit confused and uncertain over what the actual fat content of a bag is (read the label of unpopped kernals v.s. popped corn--whaat?); as near as I can tell it is 2g of fat per popped bag, which yields approximately 3 cups of popped corn. Excellent! Since this is kettle corn, it is a great fix for a sweet tooth that also wants a crunchy snack. I was pleasantly surprised, & will have this in my cupboard 24/7 for those snack-attack moments without guilt. Definitely give this one a try!

review/summary: artificially sweetened...
review/text: An unhappy surprise- from now on I will be reading the ingredients label for kettle korn. A little bit about my palette: I don't do diet sodas, stevia, or any type of low calorie beverages or products (except certain flavors of gum), because most artificial sweeteners leave an aftertaste in my mouth. If you enjoy diet sodas, crystal light drink powders and such, or have to use artificial sweeteners for health reasons- then maybe you will enjoy this popcorn. However, if you are looking for the type of kettle korn flavor and texture you get at the local fair- prepare to be disappointed. This does not have the caramelization crunch factor due to the artificial sweetener- which does not caramelize.

review/summary: Best Baby Food by Far and the Best Flavor!!!
review/text: Earth's Best Baby FoodMy favorite brand of baby food by far. Both my son (who is now over 2 years old) and my daughter (now almost one) have used a wide variety of foods from Earth's Best. I am a huge proponent of feeding children primarily organic and/or locally grown foods to promote proper nutrition and growth. But I do not feel that all organic brands are equal. I've tried many varieties (including store brands and others only available through internet purchase) and found that Earth's Best is by far the best for your money.Apples 4oz SizeThis is a great product and flavor. It's basic, almost every baby I know loves apples and the size is so much better because it's just big enough. On the rare occasion that my son or daughter can't/couldn't finish in one sitting I could put it in the fridge until the next time they sat down to eat. The price is great too, especially if you sign up for a subscription. I like it because if I need another set sooner than it would normally ship I can alter that in my subscription listing. It makes this a great value and a great product.

When it finally arrived I tried it out in some vanilla ice cream and vanilla yogurt. It tastes nothing like cotton candy and doesn't even have a candy like flavor to it...more of a strawberry. It is horrible and I am very upset since there is no returns on grocery items.

review/summary: Awesome Lollipops
review/text: These are hard candy lollipops that are so yummy you just can't stop eating them. The flavor is very similar to actual cotton candy. I have ordered the variety pack as well, and those are also just as good. A few may come broken, but that is almost impossible to prevent due to the fact that they are being shipped. I still eat the broken ones, i just open them up and put them in a bowl, they are still good. They stay in the wrapper even if they break, so they are still clean. 12 bucks for 48 lollipops is a really fair price, so I don't think it's that big of a deal if a few come broken. I have ordered them about 3 or 4 times, and there's usually only about 5 or 6 that come broken. I have never seen them in any of the stores I shop at either. It's hard to find just good old fashion candy. They ship very fast and come in the manufacture box, with bubble wrap around it, in an Amazon box. I can't imagine there is much more they could do to prevent breakage anyway. I would recommend them for sure, you won't regret it.

review/summary: Cotton Candy Pops
review/text: These are yet another great sucker from Charms.I'd never had these before, (I usually pound down Blow Pops) and decided to give them a shot to keep some variety in my diet. I eat a lot of candy to deal with medication-induced nausea, and nothing beats it down faster, (and I do mean nothing) than very sweet candy. The sweeter the better.How do these taste? They are definitely cotton candyish. I say "ish" because they aren't exactly like it, but are close enough that you can taste it in there. The flavor is like a mix of the pink and blue flavors, so the blend makes it seem a little off from what the real candy tastes like. But they are for sure a good flavored pop. They also have very little aftertaste.Since these are a flat sucker you will get a few that are broken in most boxes. It's kind of an expected issue with any hard flat candy. They could probably prevent any breakage by bubble wrapping them individually, but then they would cost $5.00 each.After reading the one-star review on these I decided to mention that these are NOT actual cotton candy on a stick. (See picture I posted.) I know it seems that this should be obvious to any rational adult or thinking child, but... apparently it's not as obvious as one would think. If these were actual cotton candy they would last about one microsecond after hitting the tongue. SO be glad they are a hard candy.Overall a five star treat.

review/summary: disappointed
review/text: There is nothing fluffy about this product but the box appears to have a picture on the top that seems to advertise that way. These are hard candy lollipops! I had wanted cotton candy fluffy lollipops. They also arrived with about 12 broken or cracked of the 48 in the box and likely came that way from the manufacturer. Fortunately I only needed 33 for a classroom .. but I would never order these again.

review/summary: Yummy-yummy -much better than expected
review/text: I mistakenly ordered this too early for Fathers Day, so I got to pre-sample - haha. These are the biggest most perfectly baked cookie I have ever seen. Plus they are a made with a normal -no processing agents - recipe. They are better than my homemade because they are perfectly baked, --no hard bottoms, perfectly light brown -- not dry. One cookie is a meal for me and there are 16 in the container. If your dad likes home-made chocolate chips cookies - you and he will be very with this gift. (warm in microwave 7-8 seconds before eating for an out-of-the-oven taste.)

review/text: Being a "modern" busy mom, I sent these cookies to my son at college. While I haven't tried them, my son raved about how great they taste, and the size is impressive. He felt there were quite a few cookies, shared them with friends, and would love to have them delivered again. It only took 2 days because I placed the order on a Monday. So, I don't feel guilty for not baking the cookies myself!

review/text: This is a flavorful, portable, high quality tea. These Adagio tea bags taste better than ninety percent of the teas out there. This blend has a floral light taste. Oolongs & Green teas should not be boiled or overly steeped, 2-3 minutes max using one tablespoon for each eight ounces of water. These teas are good hot, but are also fine for iced tea. If you like it a bit sweet I would add a few drops of a good quality Clover Honey. If you like it with a Citrus zing, a tiny sliver of Lime or Lemon peel goes well. These are definitely worth the price.

review/text: I like the flavor of this product and it's a great way to eat salt without eating too much of it. The one caveat here is that you don't pour extra salt on to compensate for the lower strength of the flavor. This may sound silly if you haven't tried it, but it's very easy to catch yourself pouring more on which is just as bad as eating regular salt.

review/text: You wouldn't believe how many different brands I ordered in an attempt to find the recipe done properly. We normally get a case of damson preserves every year from South Boston, VA, and they are so delicious; we share them with all of our friends. This year, unfortunately, there was a shortage of damsons, so we couldn't acquire a single jar from South Boston. I thought I couldn't possibly try another jar of inferior damson, and then a jar arrived from Tiptree, and I thought...okay, one more time...WOOHOO!!! You have the pieces of damson fruit in there, exactly how we like! This is what MAKES or breaks a recipe for damson preserves (not to mention the top quality ingredients of course). So thank you. I wish they weren't so expensive so we could order more. I would dock you a star, but I can't bring myself to give you only 4 stars because the product is so outstanding. Yum, yum, yum! Thank you from California.

review/text: Ever since damson plum preserves were not to be found on ordinary grocer's shelves due to the blight that afflicted damson plums in the U.S. i have searched for a product that most nearly resembled the taste and look of the damson plum preserves my grandmother used to make every September after purchasing a bushel of damson plums at Findlay Market in Cincinnati. No luck, however, until, on a visit to Bermuda, I found the Tiptree product. Tastes and looks exactly like hers, and Amazon.com brings it right to my door! It's got everything except the occasional plum stone that escaped Grandma's watchful eye. I've tried many, many jars of supposedly damson plum jellies, jams, and preserves, but nothing comes close to Tiptree.

review/summary: Nice Chamomile Tea
review/text: ****Tazo's Calm Herbal Infusion is a nice chamomile tea. I taste the chamomile and some flavorings, and they are not unpleasant, just hard to pin down as to what they are besides the chamomile. In general I'm not a big fan of tea with flavorings added, preferring the subtleness and authentic taste of the real thing.The ingredients in Calm are: chamomile flowers, hibiscus flowers, spearmint, lemongrass, rose petals, blackberry leaves, safflowers, peppermint, sarsaparilla, lemon balm, licorice and natural flavors. It is caffeine-free!Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a soothing blend of chamomile blossoms and other relaxing herbs." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Calm as "creamy, floral, minty, toasty, sweet, honey-like. As the name gently implies, Tazo Calm has a lovely floral bouquet with an apple-like flavor and distinct toasty notes. Naturally sweet in a nice light way, with a smooth finish". Tazo describes the aroma as "minty, hay like, rose". I don't taste all of these various flavors, but I do taste the chamomile, and it is fine, not overwhelming or as artificial tasting as several of the other Tazo teas I've sampled.I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Calm gets only four stars.****

But my best friend offered me some tea and it was Tazo passion and i fell in love with it. i wanted some of my own but the store i went to only had Calm and Awake. So those were the ones I bought. Calm is wonderful because it is Camomile (I think i spelled that right) and i love Camomile tea anyway so that was just right for me. I haven't tried Awake yet but I will. I must order the passion though.

review/summary: baby food expires soon
review/text: Earth's best organic food are wonderful if you're on the go and didn't have time to make your baby's food.The food that was shipped expires in two months! Since it was a good price, I thought I would stock up. If I knew this, I would not have purchased it! The baby food that i purchased last week at our local Whole Foods Market expires in two years.Now i'm stuck with 48 jars of pears that will expire in two months.

review/summary: EB Pears
review/text: Earth's Best makes good baby food that my child likes. However, I am rating their product here as it is available through Amazon. I'm very disappointed, like the other reviewer said, about the very short expiration date.A few days before I ordered this, the page said it wasn't in stock and that it would be available Sept. 15th. I ordered on the 15th, and it arrived on the 17th as promised with the free 2-day shipping. My case was supposedly the restocked pears, but the expiration date is Nov 09. New stock shouldn't have an expiration date that is only 2 months away, even if it is on sale! In the grocery store, the expiration date usually is 1 or 2 years away.

review/text: Earth's Best Pears are our son's favorite of the EB fruits. He has significant feeding delays due to complications as a micro-preemie, but he's always done well with the pears.We have ordered several cases of the pears from Amazon and have had no problems with expiration dates. All cases have had expiration dates many months from the purchase date.

Another good thing is that they taste so good that I don't mind finishing them if she gets full. Ha! Can't say that about all her baby food! :D

Remember these are by no means gourmet but it is sufficient considering what it is.As a general note the chicken ones are pretty good, the beef ones are simply OK, and the vegeterian ones are not fit for human consumption.

review/summary: much better than I expected
review/text: I ordered Erin Baker's fruit & nut cookies at a discounted price because Amazon said the item was near its sell-by date. I was nervous about doing so -- afraid I might have to scarf down a dozen cookies all at once because they were about to expire. But the cookies arrived at the beginning of September, and the expiration date isn't until Nov. 11. Plenty of time, especially since these cookies taste so good, they won't last long!I haven't tried any other Erin Baker cookies, but I definitely recommend the Fruit & Nut flavor. They have a spicy aroma and a chewy, moist texture, with just the right amount of tender fruit. The density reminds me somewhat of an Odwalla bar, but without the overpowering soy taste of an Odwalla.These cookies can serve as a meal replacement. They are filling, and with more nutrition than you might think (6 grams of protein). The only reason I didn't give these cookies five stars is that they're a bit higher in calories (290) than a typical granola bar or protein bar. But taste-wise, they're just about perfect.

review/summary: Yummy Yummy Good for Your Tummy! IMPORTANT! SEE FOLLOW-UP REVIEW
review/text: I am so addicted to these cookies! Love them! They are great for a meal substitute or snack . Not too sweet-just right. They are good for you too. What else could you want? No more dessert store bought cookies for us. One cookie and a glass of milk is pretty filling for me as the cookies are sizable. My son likes two at a time though. (Sometimes I do too!) We have disabilities in our home so 'easy' is a word we love. At first we tried the Morning Glory Cookies and loved those so ordered 4 more different kinds, caramel apple, banana nut, peanut butter with chocolate, fruit and nut . We all loved them all. The Caramel Apple went first though. My son's favorites are caramel apple, peanut butter with chocolate and banana nut. Frozen we heat in microwave 25 seconds. You really must freeze these because they are all natural. Someone said it reminded them of fruitcake but I didn't think that. I really like this one. I like the texture of the nuts in it. I want one right now but unfortunately we are out Darn it! It is not one of my son's favorites but mine and my Mom's. Do not hesitate to try these in any flavor. They are a bargain. We are getting the automatic monthly shipping next month which is even more of a bargain and will order probably 10 packages at least, for 3 people. I told you we love them!IMPORTANT FOLLOW-UP- I felt this was important to add. I had not finished my test yet so did not mention it before. I have a rare bile duct disease from a "botched' surgery. I have to be very careful what I eat or I get terrible pains and cramping and am prone to getting pancreatitis. The list of what I can eat is very short. I loved these so decided to eat mostly just the cookies for a week, if I could, without having any pains and still feel like I always do , which is really pretty awful. I felt they are nutritious and I would drink LOTS of liquids with them as the fiber can be very constipating, and of course, take vitamins. Not only did I feel better and had more energy than before but I had NO stomach pains at all. I can't remember the last time when I have gone a week without pains. I expected some but there were none. I will say, I did not miss other foods either and actually craved these cookies. I love sweets but have to be careful and these are enough sweet to satisfy me. My son brought a cake home and I found it to be almost sickeningly sweet and no nutritional value. With the cookies It just feels like I am eating well and enjoying it immensely at the same time. (Oh, I was 'regular" as well). These will continue to be a large part of my diet. It is so wonderful to feel better, have more energy and not have the horrible pains. Now if I can afford to buy as many as I need and for my Mom and son! I really need at least 5 cookies most days (3 meals a day plus 2 snacks) if I eat nothing else . Actually the price is very affordable for most at about 1.00 a cookie and less if you get automatic ordering which I am going to do at the first of every month. I can't believe I just now heard of these on Amazon! I am thankful to Erin for developing these cookies which are literally changing my life. God bless you Erin, and your business.

This made for a very convenient breakfast for them after their practice and morning workouts! Paired with milk or a piece of fruit, this was definitely a filling and satisfying breakfast for them.We enjoy the moistness, density and great flavor of fruit and nut. We have tried other flavors, but this one rates top of the list. We also feel it's a healthy option for "on the run" mornings.GIVE THEM A TRY!!!

review/summary: Breakfast cookies hit the spot!
review/text: I first tried these cookies years ago and loved them. However, there was a problem with the nutritional information listed on the wrapper, and I learned that they were much higher in calories than I'd thought. I stopped eating them and actually forgot all about them. Recently I was getting coffee at the local mall and they had the cookies for sale. I bought one and rediscovered how good they are. They're moist & chewy, with large pieces of whatever fruit, nut or chocolate is in that particular flavor. They're delicious right out of the wrapper or heated in the microwave for a few seconds. They're pretty filling and definitely satisfy my craving for the occasional sweet. I can eat them without feeling like I indulged in empty calories. I have to say that my daughter doesn't care for them at all -- she says they taste "oat-y", like a horse treat! I understand what she means, but I don't mind what I think of as the 'organic flavor'.I've purchased 3 different flavors: Chocolate Chunk Raisin, Fruit & Nut, and Double Chocolate Chunk Cherry (seasonal flavor). They're all delicious! Because they're high in calories, I reserve them for a special treat, usually as a bedtime snack. I appreciate that there is no high fructose corn syrup in these cookies. Obviously since they're individually packaged there is built-in portion control. They're pricey, but in my opinion they're worth it.

review/summary: Delicious and healthy breakfast food -- good quality and taste!
review/text: These are delicious, the quality is very good, and they make a great quick breakfast. You can toast them (crispy outside crust) or just pop 'em in the microwave (softer, moister) for 30-45 seconds -- they're good either way.These "breakfast cookies" are better (and healthier) than you might think. They are quite hearty, taste good, and are nutritious. They come in many different flavors. Most of the flavors are too sweet for my taste, but this one is good. Other favorites are the "Morning Glory," "Oatmeal Raisin," and "Banana Walnut" flavors. Be sure to store them in your freezer (as suggested) and they will taste fresh and keep for a long time. They are packaged in a heavy wrapper and plastic bag which works well for freezer storage.I use subscribe & save (best value) and keep 2 or 3 flavors on hand. They make a great quick breakfast when you are in a rush, but I enjoy them even on a relaxed morning, as they are very good and satisfying with a nice cup of coffee. There are now one of my favorite breakfast items and I recommend them highly.

review/summary: Lactose free breakfast
review/text: Not all varieties of Erin's Breakfast cookies are lactose free, but many are. For lactose intolerant people like me that is very important. Read ingredients carefully . . . but, if you are lactose intolerant, you do this already. There are a number tasty varieties, and they always arrive in a timely way.

review/summary: Erin Baker Breakfast Cookies
review/text: So far, I have tried caramel apple, fruit & nut, morning glory, and banana walnut flavers. I have also ordered, (but not yet received) the pumpkin spice cookies. All of them are an excellent meal replacement or nutritious snack. The ingredients are wholesome, there is no high fructose corn syrup, and they have a good supply of protein & fiber to stave off hunger for several hours. The caramel apple is probably my favorite because it seems to be the moistest, but I really love all of the flavors. Like other reviewers, I freeze them, and then microwave a cookie for 20 seconds when I am ready to eat it. I find the cookies taste best warmed up. Even though the calorie count is higher than many cookies, I think you get a lot of nutritional "value" with these.

review/summary: Not my top favorite
review/text: but certainly good enough to put on Subscribe and Save. They are a bit like a less dense fruitcake without the weird red and green "fruits". I didn't find these at all dry. They are a good change of pace from the chocolate and the oatmeal varieties. I don't use these just for breakfast. With a glass of milk they make a good fast meal when I have no time for anything else. I do freeze and then heat in the microwave. One caveat - don't eat too many of these (any of them) in succession. They do have a real tendency to loosen things up if you know what I mean.

review/summary: Delicious and Healthy Cookies
review/text: I purchased two of these cookies when in Seattle and went looking online to buy them about 2 months later. I have purchased 2 dozen on Amazon and had them shipped cross-country to me. I followed the suggestion to freeze them to keep better. They are very good and give a "hearty meal" feeling anytime of the day. It says they are toaster friendly but I have only warmed one up in the microwave. I will probably re-order although I have been searching the internet for a recipe that might bake up as good as the real thing.

They are dense and cannot be confused with a dessert cookie. One for breakfast along with a cup of coffee keeps me satisfied until lunch. I also like the Fruit and Nut ones.

I haven't had any flavor that I don't like, but the chocolate chunk raisin is my favorite. At Christmas time, there's a wonderful version with cherries in it. They're even great warmed in the microwave for a few seconds. Just love these cookies!

Like all the breakfast cookies, chocolate chunk raisin is nourishing and filling, starting the day with the cookie makes it easy to keep weight down. Well done, Erin.

review/summary: Breakfast cookies hit the spot!
review/text: I first tried these cookies years ago and loved them. However, there was a problem with the nutritional information listed on the wrapper, and I learned that they were much higher in calories than I'd thought. I stopped eating them and actually forgot all about them. Recently I was getting coffee at the local mall and they had the cookies for sale. I bought one and rediscovered how good they are. They're moist & chewy, with large pieces of whatever fruit, nut or chocolate is in that particular flavor. They're delicious right out of the wrapper or heated in the microwave for a few seconds. They're pretty filling and definitely satisfy my craving for the occasional sweet. I can eat them without feeling like I indulged in empty calories. I have to say that my daughter doesn't care for them at all -- she says they taste "oat-y", like a horse treat! I understand what she means, but I don't mind what I think of as the 'organic flavor'.I've purchased 3 different flavors: Chocolate Chunk Raisin, Fruit & Nut, and Double Chocolate Chunk Cherry (seasonal flavor). They're all delicious! Because they're high in calories, I reserve them for a special treat, usually as a bedtime snack. I appreciate that there is no high fructose corn syrup in these cookies. Obviously since they're individually packaged there is built-in portion control. They're pricey, but in my opinion they're worth it.

review/text: These cookies are a life saver in the morning! I am busy chasing my toddler around as soon as her tiny feet hit the floor when she gets out of bed. I take one of these out of the freezer and pop it in the microwave for 30 seconds while I chop up fruit for Tiny's breakfast. When she points at my breakfast asking for a bite, I feel good knowing these cookies aren't frankenfood and give her few pinches to share with her. They are a great way to start the day; paired with a cup of coffee, a bit of fruit and a glass of water -- I am totally full until lunch.The chocolate chunk raisin flavor is great, plump raisins keep the cookie moist and the large chunks of chocolate are very good.These are such a deal at less than a buck a cookie with S&S; on amazon; the ingredients and consistant product quality make it money well spent.

review/summary: Excellent chocolate taste
review/text: One of my favorite candies is rasinettes. This is the closest cookie I have found to that taste. It also has one of the best tasting chocolate tastes of any store bought cookie I have ever had. Add to that, they are invididually wrapped and a substantial size, this is a very good buy. Especially if you like soft cookies like I do. There is a good amount of rasins in the cookies, but they do not overwhelm at all the chocolate but compliment it.I know Erin also sells just a chocolate cookie. If it is the same used here, I would highly recoomend that as well if you are not particularly fond of rasins or raisins or don't want them to get in the way of your chocolate.

review/summary: Desiccated coconut
review/text: Honestly, I think the other negative reviews here aren't fair. The product is described as desiccated coconut (also described as powdered coconut), and that's what it is. It's a bit finer than what I can get back home but at least it's dried. It's proved impossible to find in the local shops around MA that are near me. With this I can make ANZAC biscuits, and they will be glorious.

review/text: These hard candies are excellent - very tasty. They are sweetened with Splenda so are o.k. for diabetics like myself. The first bag I purchased had clear wrappers. When they were stored for a while the wrappers stuck to the candy and were hard to peel off. The second bag had the candies wrapped in a piece of foil before being wrapped in plastic. They were much easier to unwrap after being stored for a while. I gave them 4 stars rather than 5 because I feel that they are quite expensive for what you get.

review/summary: MY FAVORITE CRACKER
review/text: [...] These crackers are far superior to the other brand of big round crackers! No trans-fats! The Milton crackers come out of the package crisp and have a sweet nutty overtone that blends well with many different toppings. My family particularly likes them paired with gourmet cheeses or kipper snacks. The black sesame seeds give these crackers a distinctive appearance. The black and regular sesame seeds and poppy seeds are whole and may be a concern to those sensitive to seeds in their diets. For readers with allergies, please note these crackers contain wheat, soy, corn and sesame seeds. There are 130 mg of sodium and 70 calories in two crackers. While these won't replace crushed up saltines in my tomato soup, they are my first choice for about every other occasion.

review/summary: Great balsamic for the price
review/text: There are different levels of balsamic vinegar. The "tradizionale" is consortium-approved and is generally over $100 for a four to five ounces and could be over $500 for a tiny amount. The next level is the "condimento balsamico" which is not consortium approved, but is about half the price or less than the previous type. The last level is "Aceto Balsamico di Modena", which can be really bad and there are no controls over what goes into it (artificial coloring, etc.).That being said, Fondo Carrate vinegar is producted from grapes grown without the use of pesticides or herbicides of any kind. Organically grown and produced exclusively from ancient D.O.C. Lambrusco varieties of the Mastri, Salamino and Sorbara grapes. It is 12 years old and aged in oak. Very smooth, sweet, but tangy. It really is a fine vinegar, especially for the price. You can get it for a bit less than $32 from other distributors, but I'm not sure how the shipping compares. Check around -- it's definitely worth finding a supplier for this stuff.

review/text: I purchased their 6 year old balsamic and it had that cancer causing caramel coloring in it so when you pay 10 times the price of something I could have bought at a local store and it has the same unhealthy ingredients in it, it doesn't make me want to chance purchasing a more expensive item from the same company. I could have bought 32 two liter bottles of Wal Mart cola for the amount I paid for one bottle of their 6 year old balsamic if I wanted to buy something with this cancer causing ingredient in it.

Although they don't really take the nausea away, they do provide a somewhat soothing relief and take the edge off a bit. I've found that with my pregnancy sickness, I often get a yucky taste in my mouth after I eat, but chewing gum makes me feel even worse for some reason. These at least leave a pleasant taste in my mouth.

If you're thinking ginger flavor like ginger ale, this isn't even close. They were spicy and bitter and just plain icky - I tried twice, but couldn't keep one in my mouth longer than about 45 seconds. Bummed that I wasted the money on these, I could have bought Preggie Pops instead for the same price - and they actually taste good!! Would recommend ginger root capsules instead.

review/text: On a recent ferry ride, the crew handed out Gin Gins to help passengers with motion sickness. I wasn't sick, but I took one anyway and have been looking for them in stores ever since! Finally I found them on Amazon and just ordered them here. I only just received my order today and I can't stop sucking on them. I have yet to use them on an upset stomach, so I can't attest as to how well they work for that, but just as a candy they're addicting and delicious! Shortly after the ferry trip, when I couldn't find them in stores, I got some crystallized ginger (not by The Ginger People,) thinking it would be about the same thing. It definitely wasn't. It only served to inform me that I actually don't like straight ginger much at all; it's way too strong for my taste. But this candy has the perfect amount of sweetness, and yet still the warm punch of ginger that makes it perfect. Delicious!

review/summary: they seem to help my son
review/text: My 7-year-old gets carsick, and we've started using both these and wristbands on twisty rides, and it seems to be helping. Don't know if it's the bands or the gin-gins, but it's working so we're sticking with it.

review/text: I bought these while I was pregnant because I was having terrible morning sickness. Me thinking I was getting something I could actually take was very wrong. These are not what I would call "candy" They are very spicy when you put them in your mouth. I did not have more then 2 before they went in the trash. I would rather have morning sickness then eat these.

review/summary: Great Product from a great company The Ginger People
review/text: I first discovered the Ginger people Christmas of 2005. A friend picked up a bottle of Ginger Peanut Sauce from T.J. Max, as they knew I liked ginger. I cooked with it, making things like Asian snap peas, which my friends started requesting at pot luck get togethers. (They thought I spent hours making them) Sadly my bottle was running out. I looked on line to try to find more and ran across the Ginger People's website. I ordered a half a case of the Ginger Peanut sauce, and decided to try a couple of their other sauces. (All of which are excellent by the way)The website offered "ginger chews" which I'd bought before from Trader Joe's under Trader Joe's branding. So I ordered a couple of bags of those as I knew I liked them.By having my order reach a certain amount, the shipping was greatly reduced.Being short of the amount, I decided to try the Gin-Gins, even though I'm not a hard candy kind of guy.A few months later, I was glad I did, however, as one of my new medications gave me dry mouth during the afternoon and when I talked a lot. I was able to put a Gin-Gin in my mouth which kept me from having dry mouth or having to chew on a Ginger Chew during meetings.I recently had another new med introduced, which has a side effect of nausea, the ginger chew helps calm that down, but isn't always convenient, like at meetings, socializing, or other types of interactions with others. Gin-Gins to the rescue again.If you're prone to having an upset stomach, I can't think of too many , if any better way to settle that stomach down than a true ginger based product. Gin-Gins are the perfect all around, right in any setting answer.When taking one out of my pocket, friends, co-workers, or clients, have asked to have one. I've yet to get anything put positive responses for Gin-Gins taste. So for anyone who just likes hard candy, Gin-Gins sure seem a winner with everyone I've shared with.Try them, (and other fine selections from the Ginger People) you won't be disappointed.

review/text: I'm pregnant with my second baby and my friend sent me a bag of the Gin Gins hard candy as a gift. I was hesitant to try them, especially as my stomach was turning. But I did, and I'm SO glad I did! They worked almost instantly to settle my stomach and the nausea completely disappeared! WONDERFUL! I'm going to invest in cases of these for the next three months!!!

review/summary: Moderate Relief for Morning Sickness
review/text: My mom gave me these ginger candies during my first trimester when I was pregnant with my second baby and I liked them. The taste was pleasant and although they never totally quelled the nausea, they seemed to at least take the edge off the nausea. And on the times they didn't seem to help, they at least took that horrible pregnancy taste out of my mouth. (Yuck!) I would recommend at least trying them for morning sickness; if it's bad like mine was, try anything you can!

review/summary: Relief from morning sickness!!
review/text: I am a new lover of Gin Gins hard candy!! I am newly pregnant (7 weeks) and the morning sickness, which for me is all-day sickness, began a few days ago. I feel aweful, AWEFUL. As soon as I found out I was pregnant I stocked up on anything that might help with the impending nausea - PsiBands, Preggie Pops, Ginger tea, Gin Gins. The PsiBands don't seem to work for me but the ginger candy is AMAZING. (The Preggie Pops work pretty well too.) I feel almost normal while I'm sucking on it. I don't know how or why but, seriously, after about 30 seconds of popping a ginger candy in my mouth I feel SO much better. I'm probably going to destroy my teeth by sucking on candy all day but for now it is definitly worth the relief. Thank you to everyone who rated these highly and convinced me to try them!! (My only complaint is that the candies are a little small and so seem to go fast.)

review/summary: okay for morning sickness relief
review/text: From week 6 to week 12 of my pregnancy I threw up twice a day, and felt nauseous almost 24/7. I took anti-nausea medicine, but still felt awful and was searching for any relief. These got good reviews so I ordered 2 bags. I didn't even finish half a bag. They were ok, and somewhat took the nauseous edge away, but they weren't my first choice to try for relief. Honestly the best relief I got for morning sickness were sour icebreakers, and then lemonheads. I would buy these Gin Gins only if you enjoy ginger flavor and would eat them as regular candy anyways.

review/text: We love Gin-Gins! We eat them all the time. It took a while for my kids to like them but now they love them. They work great for my daughter's motion sickness. She is good at getting that in the car and has pretty much "broke in" every vehicle we have had. Took them with us on our trip to Colorado and guess what? No upset stomachs from the curvy roads! I don't consider the ginger ale you buy at Walmart real ginger. If you want real ginger eat Gin-Gins!

review/summary: Gin Gins Hard Ginger Candy
review/text: I found this product when I looked through a search engine to find natural ginger. I was taking a medication, that made me very sick to my stomache. Because of all the other medications I was on, my doctor was reluctant to give me another medication to address this side effect, so he suggested natural ginger. The first product I found was in a super market and it was ginger pieces that I would hold in my mouth, it worked ok, but one day I was in a super market and found some all natural ginger candy and that was great. I looked for it again to no avail. When I found these online, I was thrilled, but I was even happier when they arrived!!!! I would highly recommend these to anyone who is pregnant, or going through cancer treatments, motion sickness and of course side effects from medications. They are inexpensive and worth a million!!

review/summary: Less of a kick than the chews
review/text: I bought the ginger chews at the market a few months before trying these hard candies, and I was expecting the same potency. The chews really have a burn to them when you eat them. These hard candies are much more mild. I like both, but for something you can actually enjoy for a few minutes, these are great. Wish they were perhaps a LITTLE more potent though.

review/summary: Amazing!!!
review/text: Okay, I know this review might seem a bit premature, since I only received this product yesterday, but WOW! I am 6 1/2 weeks pregnant and have been having horrible, all-day morning sickness for about a week. The minute I received these yesterday afternoon, I popped one in my mouth, and by the time I had finished sucking on it my nausea was 100 times better! Last night I was actually able to eat a real meal! This morning, I popped one in as soon as I woke up, and was able to eat a real warm breakfast (my nausea has been so bad I have seriously been limited to saltines and plain bread). I know every pregnancy is different, but if you are suffering from nausea and vomiting like I was, you owe it to yourself to give these a try!

I got them because I am pregnant and experiencing nausea. They do take the edge off! One thing that bummed me out was I found 2 wrappers that were sealed up with no candy inside. Other than that, they are ok. Not something I would eat all the time, but it does help take the edge off my nausea. I would reccommend to other pregnant women!

review/text: I usually get this ginger hard candy from &#34;Down to Earth&#34; store but they were out of it for over a month. Decided to order it from Amazon. I use it especially when I feel a cold coming on or coughing. It really soothes the throat and clears up congestion. I prefer the hard candy over the chews although the chews are good too. It also helps when your throat is dry. It's worth it with the free shipping.

Also, the individual packaging is convenient for slipping one into my pocket for a long meeting!

I keep them by my bed so if I wake up nauseous, I can pop one in my mouth before I sit up. However, they continued to be a go to for motion sickness and colds. They're great melted in hot tea when you're congested. Now, we always have some in the house!

review/text: This is a healthy and very tasty cracker. Fancy enough for guests. The product arrives fresh and not a single cracker broke during shipping. The salt content is just right and the sesame seeds give it a nice nutty flavor. I dislike crackers that are sweet or have added spices like onion powder, and this one does not.

review/text: I am so glad to see that I can purchase Milton's Whole Wheat Crackers online here at Amazon! We found these crackers at our local grocery store about 3 weeks ago and all 3 family members raved about the taste and quality of this product. To my dismay, when I returned to the store to purchase more I found that they will no longer carry this item. These crackers far surpass any cracker I have ever eaten. Full of flavor, large in size and completely satisfying! Milton's will soon be the ONLY cracker found in my home!

review/summary: tasty but iffy . . .
review/text: Being primarily vegan for over three decades, I have very high standards (maybe unrealistic) because I have very sensitive health threshold. Any indulgence tips it. Perhaps, this condition maybe of help to you.I find Milton's crackers too high in salt and spice content to eat more than a few in comfort. Although they do not have preservatives, thankfully, I would not consider them in the same league as Wasa, Kavli, or a good rice cracker in terms of purity. These wafers are larger in circumference by approximately a third, thicker, and tastier than those of their best-known competitor, Carrs, whose product is made with preservatives, sugar, and the like. They have a nice, rich taste and texture, but I definitely feel them in me the next day. Maybe it's the ferrous sulfate . . . maybe it's simply me . . .Of course, on that account, in bulk the eating may better be, an activity I engage with a certain porcine nonchalance. Rather than adventitiously attack my food, I tend to bury my snout in it, and munch.

review/summary: Fabulous taste
review/text: My sister's mother in law introduced us to these. Her husband is Scottish and she said these were the closest you could get here in the states to what they taste like over there. She warmed them up in the oven and oh my goodness they are decadent.I can't give a summary of the taste except to say that there is a start point of you need to like canned fish because that is what they are. But the flavor and the depth of flavor is phenomenal and the fish itself is much more delicate in flavor and texture than tuna is (not that they are anything like tuna, but it's the only other canned fish I'd previously eaten).They were great just out of the can cold, but better heated up (a minute or two in the microwave, ten or so in the oven). They were tasty on their own or on bagels. Apparently they are considered a breakfast food over there so that's when we had them.One can will serve three people but once you've tasted them you won't want to share.

review/summary: Great kippers! A keeper!
review/text: The John West kippers in sunflower met my requirements for a well flavored and firm kipper that does not fall apart on my fork. The can was easy to open and the quality of the fish was excellent. The smoked flavor was right on target and I can think of nothing negative to say except that it was hard to not open a second can and keep on eating! The sunflower oil packing serves the kipper well and is a healthier choice than some other packings. It did not create an oily fish, which I had feared. I will continue my subscribe & save subscription and order again regularly! The price was excellent for this larger can size and the free shipping and handling through subscribe & save is attractive!

review/text: Based on several of the very positive reviews, I splurged and tried an order. Excellent kippers! Evenly smoked and seasoned; not too salty; and pleasantly oiled. The sunflower oil emptied from the tin and displayed freshness and tasted perfect. Comparing this to the much cheaper selections is typical. . . you get what you pay for. While John West kippers are more expensive per ounce compared to some others, the product is a full magnitude fresher tasting and worth repeated eating! The other kipper choices tried will be given to deserving pets and unwanted guests! Many stars for John West Kippers!

review/text: Having grown up in London and being very familiar with Shepherds Pie, I thought it would be convenient to use this mix and, as it was produced in England, anticipated that it would be a good product. I was wrong and very disappointed. Even though I added vegetables to the mix, it remained bland and flavorless. It needs a lot of work to make it tasty and, that being the case, you might as well cook it from scratch - it's not that difficult.

The next time I went to purchase more, I noticed (after paying) that the price went up $3 per can. My local Sam's Club now sells the 38oz cans for about $1.50 LESS. I'm very disapointed in Amazon.

review/summary: Great product with RESEARCH behind it!
review/text: This is a great product! My 4 year old daughter was actually on this formula before it came on the market. She was part of the research study done to test this product by a major medical university. They tested so many things on her including bone density, brain activity, eye sight, body fat, etc. so I know they were interested in how good this formual was. Also, because the formual was so good, it was taken to the market earlier than anticipated because babies did so well on it.A side note, my 7 month old participated in a new Enfamil lipil study as they are testing to see if they change the percentage of fat if the babies will absorb more calcium.

review/text: The info states is a manufacturer discontinued item. Although it my be exactly what we see on shelves it may be nearing its exp date. The label in the pic is the old one (new ones are shinny gold). Sams has it for $29.38 plus tax so it's probably a wash when you compare Amazon's sales tax savings (you do declare this on your State tax form..right!) and free shipping.

This is a great price for Enfamil Lipil formula, especially when combined with the free shipping Amazon offers. Since this is the only formula my baby will drink, I take advantage of this offer often. With the larger can, it lasts longer and you don't have to order so many at once. Also you don't have a ton of small cans to store. Great!

review/summary: A Real Low-Sodium Soup
review/text: I am on a low-sodium/sodium restricted diet for something called Meniere's Disease. As a result I have to keep my sodium under 2000mg a day, although I find it's best if I keep it between 1200 and 1800 a day, trying to hit about 1500.Most the time when I look for soup at the store, it's reduced sodium (meaning it's NOT low-sodium, but has less than the original version...low-sodium products always have to be 140mg or less). This is an actual low sodium product.While many of the reduced-sodium soups are 400-600mg a serving, a serving is not always a whole can.What I like about this is that it's 140mg for a whole 10.75 oz can. The other thing I like is that it has a lot of FLAVOR.Also, this price is pretty good. When my Target has it, that's when it actually has it, it is under $2, but my local grocery store, where I normally buy it, is over $2.I've tried several low-sodium broths before, and none of them had flavor, or at least not a good one, and are only good when used as an ingredient, and not as a soup. This actual tastes like the chicken soup my mom used to make when I was a kid, and can no longer have.In my opinion, just the right amount of chicken chunks, noodles, and veggies.If you want to kick up the flavor some more, you can add a little pepper or parsley...or even a pinch of sodium-free bouillon, such asWyler's Instant Bouillon, Sodium Free Chicken, 2.62-Ounce Units (Pack of 12)or Herb-Ox Chicken Instant Broth & Seasoning, Sodium Free, 8-Count Packets (Pack of 12).The Herb-Ox is a bit more expensive, but if you make anything that it's the main flavoring, it's worth the extra cost. As a side-note, both also make sodium-free beef bouillons. I use both the beef and chicken to make mashed potatoes, gravies, roasts...anything that needs that something extra.My real recommedation with this soup though, is to try it before you tweak it. As I said, it has a LOT of FLAVOR already, and odds are you won't want to add anything.Just in case you want to know the full-nutrition, here it is:Nutrition Facts**Amount Per Serving (serving size) = 1 canCalories 160Total Fat 4.5gSat.

The advert also states that you are getting "90% Off" - I don't know of ANYONE that would pay $90 for one box of 20 tea bags. The statement in this case rings true, "If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!" Even after contacting the seller, I received NO reply. Shady business practices and this seller should be avoided.

review/summary: I Like John West quality!
review/text: John West brand sardines & herring are tasty and excellent quality. The Skippers (2 layer sardines packed in safflower oil) are tasty. If you compare the Skippers to King Oscar 2-layer in olive oil, this may be a tie score and dependent on your tastes and uses. I like the King Oscar version a touch better. Neither the JW or KO sardines are cheap but the quality and flavor are worth the cost, imho.

review/summary: Top Notch Flour
review/text: I have tried many kinds of bread flours, and on a gut instinct read the one review and thought, I need to try it. I make an authentic long pre-ferment San Fran sourdough, which has no added yeast. I do believe this flour yields a good strong gluten, enabling the natural sourdough to do its thing. The crust is just perfect, and what big loaves I get!!! And the most delicious perfect sourdough flavor ever. I know alot about bread baking and have studied it a lot, and still I know very little. I do know this flour is different, and am very pleased with the results. You will need a new garbage can with a good lid as this is a LOT of flour.

review/summary: Search for perfect artisan flour ended here.
review/text: I'm nearly finished using my first 50 lb bag of Honeyville Artisan Flour, and am ordering a second. Before ordering, I contacted their customer service person, who took time to answer my questions about flour processing and content.My sourdough thrives on this flour; the dough is easy to knead and form, with just the right % of gluten and malt, plus the added bonus of no bleach!Just out of the oven, I can hear the caramel brown crust crackling - just like it should. The crust is crunchy and chewy; the bread is moist and full of bubbles - a difficult combination to achieve.I make 5 or 6 loaves of Austrian sourdough bread a week, enough to eat and plenty to share. Friends and neighbors say these loaves are sooo delish. Leftover slices make wonderful French Toast.The lower shipping costs make my hubby happy.

review/summary: Amazing product!
review/text: This product is amazing! Thank you Honeyville for this magnificent flour. I've finally found what I was looking for in my breads -- this absolutely makes a huge difference. The look, the taste, the crust - everything comes out as intended. If I ever open my own bakery I know who I will be ordering my flour from.When compared to other flours, even the KA brand (*bread makers will know who I'm talking about*), this flour is miles apart from competition. Gluten strands develop quickly due to higher protein %, the dough comes out creamy and easy to deal with.This dough is perfect for baking artisan loafs, making your own pizza and spaghetti. Now, if you are looking to bake cakes with it, don't even try. You'd have to find a more appropriate flour type for the task.I'm very pleased with the delivery too. It was delivered within couple of days, the sack was packaged in a box and came undamaged. The shipping charge is also quite unusual for the weight of the package. Please keep it this way though. Again, I'm very pleased with the product. Will be coming back for more. And as others have already stated, espacially if you bake often, 50Lbs is not as much as you think but should last you quite a while.

I bagged it n 1 gallon plastic bags and packed them into a large lard can to keep fresh.. the container is now in our root cellar. For my first loaf I tried a basic French Bread recipe that includes beaten egg whites added to the water.. no oil.. just flour, sugar, yeast, water, salt.. and, from 1lb 4 oz of flour I produced the most awesome, seriously authentic French style baguettes (x2) that I have EVER made! I have no idea what makes this unbleached flour so special, but I'm not looking back!

review/summary: Best cup of coffee I have ever had...
review/text: After reading many of the reviews I think I have figured out the problem. You guys have the wrong POD brewer. I have a BUNN and tried various different pods with it. The Aloha Island pods are the best of the lot. I have been in search of a good cup of coffee for years. The answer is a BUNN and the Aloha dark roast Pods. I bought two el-cheapo pod brewers including black and decker and senseo. I couldn't get a good cup of coffee even with the Aloha pods. Once I ditched the cheap pod brewer and spent the $200.00 on the BUNN, all my troubles were over. You guys will never be happy until you get a good pod brewer.

review/text: After reading the reviews, I was hesitant. However, I've gotten a perfect cup every time so far with my Senseo.The coffee is very good, but it has fallen a little short of my expectations. I've previously brought Kona back from my Hawaiian vacations and ground it myself. The pod coffee is not quite as good as fresh ground.UPDATE: for my next shipment, this two-cup style was backordered. Aloha Island Coffee Co. sent me the equivalent amount of coffee in single-cup style pods instead. I've found these pods to work better, fit the Senseo machine better, and this coffee now does tasted just as good (or better) than fresh ground whole bean Kona!I think the single-pod style is quite a bit more expensive than two-cup style, but the difference is definitely noticeable!

review/summary: First excited, then disappointed....
review/text: I really do like my Senseo coffee maker. I, like others who have reviewed the Kona Pods here, was always searching for a better tasting coffee pod to use in the machine. I was excited to see that Kona now made pods and was also happy to see that they had a pod that was a '2 cup style'. I have not found it to be a huge deal to use 2 smaller '1 cup' size pods, but it sounded nice to be able to just put one large pod in the machine instead of 2 smaller one.After reading some of the reviews here, I could not figure out what some of the reviewers meant by the Kona pods making different amount of coffee per cup each time or how the coffee could be strange and undrinkable. It just didn't make sense. Well, it still doesn't make sense, but it certainly happened with the coffee I made using the Kona pods also.My results were overall poor and it was very disappointing as the Kona pods cost a lot more than Folgers or other pod brands that I can buy locally. The first thing I noticed was that the coffee in the 2 cup sized Kona pods is packed in much more tightly than in any other pod I have ever used in my Senseo. The instructions for the Kona pods say to wiggle the pods to break up the coffee before inserting into the machine. The Kona pods feel very hard when taken out of their package. I always wiggled and jiggled the pods for about 10 seconds before putting them in the Senseo. After my problems with the Kona pods, my husband decided that I was not 'wiggling' them enough. He promptly wiggled one to the point that it broke open. So, there is just so much that can be done to the pod before putting it in the machine.The first thing that I noticed was that the amount of coffee brewed when using the Kona pod was quite a bit less than when using 2 smaller pods. That did not make much sense, but after several cups of Kona, it was obvious that there was never the amount of coffee coming out as before when using 2 small one cup pods. The best I can figure out is that the Kona pods themselves seem to 'hold' a lot more water. There is more water that remains in the pod itself after the brewing is done. The pod itself is heavier when I take it out to throw it away. So, I believe the reason that there is less actual coffee using Kona pods is that the pods themselves retain a lot more water and it cannot pass through into the coffee cup.Then, as others have mentioned, there is the problem that happens to me about 1/2 the time when using the Kona pods. The problem is that for whatever reason, the water does not actually go through and penetrate the Kona pods during the brewing cycle. The 'coffee' that is supposed to be coming out of the spout is just water! This problem is one that I still cannot really figure out. The Kona pods are a little smaller in diameter than all the other pods I have tried. So, I guess that somehow the water has enough room to 'go around' the actual pod and come out of the spout without 'going through' the pod to brew coffee. I also wonder if the paper filter of the Kona pods is different than other pods and for some reason the Kona paper is more difficult for water to penetrate. I have tried wetting the Kona pod paper filter right before starting to brew the coffee thinking that perhaps it would help the water to penetrate the paper and pod. But, that has not worked for me.So, it is back to regular more reasonably priced coffee pods for me. I have wasted too many expensive Kona pods trying to get a proper cup of coffee from them. Even when the Kona pods brew a cup of coffee, it is not as large of an amount of coffee as I get using other brands. So, adding the cost of the Kona pods to the fact that it brews a smaller amount of coffee equals a product that is way too expensive when it does actually work.I have been reading of a product called an EcoPod. It is a refillable pod for these type of coffeemakers. It might be the next thing I try.

review/summary: Great Choice for Senseo
review/text: This coffee is great! The Senseo machine can be difficult to use as far as getting pods into it correctly. I am not sure what has happened to the people reporting "steam locks" but I have had issues when:- the pod is not inserted properly- the pod holder is not seated correctly within the machine- the pod is not prepared for insertion properlyMy issues were varied, but basically consisted of hot water coming out of the sides of the coffee maker and no coffee would be brewed, and the pod would have to be discarded. This happened to me with Senseo pods, and probably would have happened with the Aloha Island pods except that I learned how to deal with the machine.Also in some of these cases the lid to the coffee maker would be stuck, (possibly the dreaded "steam lock"), but I was always able to open the machine after a minute or so of wiggling the lock/release handle on the machine, which I would think most people would do automatically when the machine doesn't open.By properly preparing the pod for insertion I am able to use single pods for the Melitta One in my Senseo as well as the Aloha Island pods and of course the Senseo pods. If you don't put it in just right, you will have problems. The key is to spread the coffee equally around within the Pod before inserting it into the machine. Do this by wiggling the pod around a bit (take about 5 seconds). The helpful instructions with the Aloha Island pods say to "break up the coffee" within the pod before using, which has the same effect. It took me five months to figure this out while using the Senseo pods, especially when brewing two cups. I wish Senseo would have included a little note like Aloha Island did.During shipping the coffee can settle or collect within the pod, either on a side(s) or even in the middle. This changes the thickness of the pod, ever so slightly, and the machines tolerance for different thickness pods appears to be extremely low!So smooth out your pods and enjoy, I think that any problems you have with pods are really problems with the design of the machine, not the pods themselves.

review/summary: Senseo machine jammed
review/text: Echoing other reviews, performance is not consistant. One time we did get excellent coffee, this morning it jammed the Senseo machine with a steam lock and there is not telling when we will be able to re-open it. Considering the price of these pods, even only one bad pod makes it impossible to recommend the product.

review/summary: Ah! Senseo pods that rock! Mahalo!
review/text: As a bachelor who frequently must grab a cup of joe at home and run, i was reluctant to waste coffee in my Braun drip machine, and disinclined to clean up after the French Press method. A New York Times article convinced me that a Pod system would be the way to go, and i found the Philips Senseo machine to be the best at the consumer level. Alas, the Douwe Egberts pods that come with are, um, IMHO, not good.A brief web search led me to Aloha Island's Senseo-style pods, and i ordered a box of their single serving espresso pods. The package arrived swiftly, and the box of pods was swaddled in styro-peanuts: nice touch! i immediately placed a pair in the Senseo unit and let it do its thing. Wow! The quality of the coffee is, to date, unparalled. Rich, smooth, and frothy, almost like a latte before the milk is added. And i was surprised that the yield was about one ounce greater than with the DE pods.I'm a believer, an advocate, and a confirmed drinker and fan. Thanks and Mahalo!

review/summary: Don't Waste Your Money!
review/text: I was thrilled to find Kona coffee in pods for my Senseo machine. However, these pods do not really fit right. Consequently, sometimes you get a full cup that is mostly water -- then you might get half a cup. There is NO consistency in how much coffee will actually come out -- or how strong/weak the coffee will be. I can't tell if it's manufacturing irregularities or whether the pods are just poorly designed. In any event, only about one in five pods actually produces a drinkable full cup of coffee. I emailed Aloha Island Coffee Company with my concerns and asking for advice, but have not yet received an answer after two weeks.I'm going back the the Douwe Egberts pods -- at least they are consistent and A LOT less expensive.

review/text: I bought a Senseo machine for the convenience of making one cup at a time but was underwhelmed by the coffee choices available.That is until I found the Kona coffee pods from Aloha Island.These are all I use now. They cost a little more but worth every penny if you want a very smooth, rich cup of pure Kona coffee these are the ones to buy.

review/summary: Messed up my senseo
review/text: I have to agree with the guy who complained about consistency. I have wasted two very expensive pods so far. The first time I used a Kona pod the machine jammed and I could not open it for 24 hours,(caused a steam lock), about 5 tablespoons of undrinkable crap came out of my senseo. The next time I tried a Kona pod I got a quarter amount of what should have been a two cup try. I am not very impressed so far. I am now afraid to try again.

review/summary: Top Quality Coffee, but Pod technology leaves something to be desired
review/text: Yes the coffee is the best quality, pesticide free. There are technical issues with the pods. 1 pod was broken when I opened up the pouch it was stored in. For any pods to arrive broken when they are so expensive is just not acceptable. Also, many times the pod is not working, but turning it around and pressing down on it with a fork or a spoon makes it work (I have Black & Decker Home Cafe Machine). Great coffee, but I felt that I had to really work for it. I also feel that to charage $15 to ship a box of coffee pods is a bit excessive, considering that they are being shiped from LA not HI.

review/summary: I don't have to beg my son to cook for me anymore....
review/text: Everyone who has had the opportunity to eat this loves this - I like this a lot with green and yellow zuccini, carrots and bamboo shoots with thin sliced turkey breast. Living too far from any real good oriental restaurants is no longer such a bummer...just came back to order more... price went up a bit but it's still well worth it.I see some complaints about too salty - I don't think it is salty and I do NOT use any salt when cooking nor do I eat any salty snacks so my taste buds would complain if this was too salty. Too hot? The way we make it, it's at most medium hot while the flavor is excellent (not diluted with coconut milk)...the hot sensation goes away very quickly...we love hot food - almost to a point of burning lips, eyes and nostrils hot but this is medium hot. Maybe it's less hot for us because we use a lot of veggies and eat it with white rice which always turns down the heat.

review/text: I had really high hopes for this brand. I used to use Thai Kitchen Green Curry Paste (check my review of it) but they changed something so I've been on the look-out for a substitute. This had great reviews and a decent price so of course I gave it a try. I've only used it once, but it was MEGA-salty. Now, I'm a person who puts salt on bacon. It's actually rare that I think something is too salty. I also made it with boxed chicken broth so maybe that added salt put it over the top?I'm gonna try this again soon using less paste and a reduced- or no-sodium broth to see if maybe that reduces the saltiness. I'll write a follow-up at that point. I REALLY want this to work!!

review/text: I had only tried one other brand of green curry and it was quite bland so decided to try this one because of the reviews. I must say it is delicious! It's definitely got some heat to it. I made some green curry with chicken and shrimp the other night and used a generous portion but it was just a bit too hot for me so I added about 1/2 cup of half and half to it and it was perfect. It cut just enough of the heat so as not to be overpoweringly spicy and it brought the other flavors together beautifully. I will definitely be getting more!

review/text: Not the best tasting curry paste. It is good, but it still requires alot of work to throw together a good curry. The taste is salty and spicy, not exactly what I look for when it comes to green curry. It takes alot of sugar to even out the flavor and make it edible.

review/summary: Hot Stuff
review/text: I was so excited to get this curry paste. The flavor was good if you can get past the heat. Wow, it is hot. My boyfriend goes to Thai resturants and orders Thai hot and then asks for some more hot sauce. He even said it was hot. The next time I make it I'll try adding less paste and additional coconut milk.

review/summary: This is not an all-in-one product
review/text: If you know what you're doing, (by which I mean, you know how to enhance a curry to draw out subtle flavors), this is a fine product. However, used alone, it's not going to create a dish that blows your palate-mind. It's good, yes, but it's very basic. So, using it and creating a great curry is going to take some finessing.If you've shopped locally, you'll know this is a terrific price. Just be prepared to have plenty of essential other ingredients available to make your dish really sing.

review/summary: just packaged curry paste quality; nothing to rave about
review/text: Many people are unnecessarily intimidated when it comes to making curry paste. I am always disappointed by the people who are impressed with the taste of curry paste manufactured between 6 months and 18 months ago. Its not hard to find the fresh ingredients and make it fresh. It takes me less than 15 minutes to make something that is far superior in taste and nutrition to this product. This product is widely used in Thai restaurants where the cooks don't want to cook, and don't want to invest the time in training workers who change restaurants every 6 months...they just want to hire untrained laborers who can open cans and scoop pre-made mixes out of containers. It takes a bit of time and practice to make curry paste, but do it a few and you can master the art of working with the spices. You will never go back to the cheap, low quality substitutes used in most Thai restaurants and sold in Asian grocery store. If you want the real thing, learn to make it or find a restaurant to support that makes their pastes from scratch.

review/summary: the best!
review/text: My cousin-in-law is Thai and she cooked an amazing curry for us. I had to have the recipe and she said it was really very simple. Just get the green Mae Ploy curry paste, some Asian basil, and some coconut milk. A little salt, sugar, chicken, some bamboo shoots and rice were the only other things I would need to make it. Well, I couldn't believe it was really THAT simple, but it was! The paste imparts several subtle and delicious flavors to the curry. Tastes like you slaved for hours. I never have leftovers when I make this curry. The paste is so low priced I plan to stock up so I'll always have some on hand. Plus-- no preservatives, no wierd ingredients. It's all food stuffs, albiet some of the ingredients I don't recognize... what is a galangal? Whatever it all is, sure tastes good!

I had never made my own currybefore, but with the help of this, I made restaurant quality curry! There is quitea bit of product in the container, so it will last if refrigerated.

I can't believe I waited 35 years to try it.We went through all of the grocery store curry pastes and never could find one that had great flavor and spice.Mae Ploy knocks it out of the park! We always have 3 or 4 of these in our fridge & pantry. These make super yummy curry with or without coconut milk (we've recently started using chicken stock instead of coconut milk to cut down on the calories)A definite MUST HAVE for curry loversAdd someMae Ploy Sweet Chili Sauce, 25-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 2)to your pantry too!

When I prepare a curry with this I don't go crazy with a lot of Thai ingredients other than the curry paste. Just some veggies from the super like bell pepper, scallions, carrots, jalapeno and serrano chilies, and some sliced pork or chicken or beef. So easy and so delicious.

review/summary: Not this company's best
review/text: The overall taste of this sauce was a disappointment to me. I love many of this company's products so I was a bit surprised that this chili paste didn't taste any better. There are bitter notes to this sauce which I attribute to chile seeds, vinegar and an excessive amount of salt. Buy some dry red pepper flakes and you'll eliminate the bitterness of this sauce but otherwise replicate it almost perfectly.I much prefer the Huy Fong's Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce. It is not only hotter but it has a wonderful sweetness to it combined with some pleasant garlic notes.This is a good company but not every one of its products hits the mark. This chili paste misses the mark by a wide margin in my view.The product label lists (in this order) chiles (with seeds), salt and then vinegar. The vinegar and salt add a lot of bitterness. As I said - I like this company's products but not this particular one. Salt and vinegar do NOT complement chiles that well in my view.

review/summary: Good Stuff
review/text: I switched over to this stuff after using Sriracha chili sauce for the longest time. Personally, I think this chili paste has a more luscious flavor and a more paste-like consistency rather than the sauce-like consistency of Sriracha.I love this stuff, I throw it on eggs, in soup, and in pretty much everything I cook in a skillet. It is SOO versatile!!It's really HOT too.IF YOU LIKE CHILI SAUCE/SRIRACHA, BUY THIS!!!! YOU'LL LOVE IT.Careful tho, I heard too much of it can mess with your stomach lining.Anyways, you can probably find this stuff at your local Asian-mart for around the same price. Amazon is pretty convenient though.

review/text: I was looking for a good quality, high gluten flour, to use in making breads that require a very slack dough. For me, this flour is perfect. Buying in bulk for my little in-the-middle-of-the-city kitchen at first seemed ridiculous, but I've already used 20 Lbs of the flour and I made the purchase just a little more than a month ago. I have very much enjoyed experimenting with this flour!The order shipped quickly, and arrived far sooner than I was expecting. So overall, I am extremely please with the product and with the seller.

We give a lot of these out to the kids in the neighborhood as presents. Today we got another 4 from a Seller --- these 4 barrels had an expiration date of 2/25/12!!!The need to realize that taking old inventory just to get rid of it during the holiday rush doesn't really work --- it's going to be a long time before I order anything from them again...

review/text: Why would a huge plastic container of round cheese balls be selling for over 20 dollars? Are you kidding me? And the worst part is that the regular cheese curls are a thousand times crunchier and tastier anyway. Cheese balls taste rather hard and lack the cheesy flavor in comparison to the actual curls. Either way expect cheese stains all over your hands, and especially the furniture and Nintendo equipment (including TV and Wii remotes) in the living room. A product that I fail to see why anyone would consider purchasing considering the many flaws.

review/text: So I bought this after watching an Alton Brown episode where he talks about Ghee being clarified butter, the best you can get, and really deals with high heat. I put it in fridge, and I scooped out what I thought was about 1/4 cup spoonful for my cooking last night. Wow! Cooks well; no more smoke than cooking on any high heat setting, and I had some left over. I think maybe you should use less than you originally use of other oils as this does not evaporate the same. Really cool stuff, and no additional taste of french fries, or other stir-fried items. Coolness!!

The price is a bit steep with the shipping but they don't always have what I want at the store so by the time I pay tax it's about the same price but at least I can get what I want all the time.

So the skillet Chicken Fried Rice Recipe on the package came in very handy. Leftover chicken, a dash of soy sauce and a drained can of bean sprouts made everyone happy except the dog...no leftovers.Well leftovers are classed up with this Asian Sides with less sodium than before.

You can serve this to guests and expect compliments.Makes a great quick lunch, too, either alone (it's really that good) or add some chicken or whatever you prefer. You could also spice it up a bit and use it as the basis for many variations.Thumbs way up for this one, good job Knorr!--------------------------------------------Update 2011-11-19: These remain a big favorite of mine.

review/text: This is not only pre-seasoned, but it makes it's own sauce. Not too much, but a fair amount. It's good; however if you let this sit a bit, it will congeal.This product makes a good balancer for spicy toppings; it helps to cut some of the heat when served with spiced foods.I admit that I'm not quite used to these kinds of products, since I typically have made rice from scratch; but I've been trying a few different convenience products just to check them out. So this, like all of them, has that "convenience food" quality to it, and you aren't going to confuse it with fresh; but for what it is, it's a nice basic that has a lot of applications.

He used 4 pouches to feed our family of 7 and there was enough left over for he and I to bring to work for lunch the next day.With a special promotion the cost was just over $1 per pouch which is a resonable price. Without the promo price it would cost more that I'm willing to pay.

review/summary: Clarification
review/text: Please note, Amazon did not incorrectly place this item in the "foods" section: This is not just a mustard-flavored, or mustard-scented oil--it's actually the oil from mustard seeds, which have been safely consumed by people in India for thousands of years.The reason the label reads "for external use only" is due to an FDA regulation: When the product is sold in the US, it must legally bear this label.This is exactly the same thing that has been used extensively in northern India for cooking for ages. This very product ("KTC Pure Mustard Oil") is sold in many Indian groceries in the U.S., and everyone there will tell you that it's used for a cooking oil. If you look on the back of the bottle you will see in the labeling "Manufactured by: KTC (Edibles) LTD."Mustard oil is actually reputed to be particularly heart-healthy, and have a lower percentage of saturated fats than canola or other edible oil. One note, it's always briefly heated to a very hot (almost smoking) point by Indian cooks right before using. This is done to get rid of a raw taste that is considered not pleasant, and to achieve a nice mellow flavor. Hope this info helps.

review/text: I rated this item with 3 stars! W/ S&H it came out to $11.95. I received it in 3 days. The oil was warm from sitting in the mail truck. It would be helpful if KTC sold this size compatible with Membership Prime Free 2-Day Shipping. I am using the pure mustard oil for my damaged/ dry processed hair, so far so good, I used it once in a homemade Mayonnaise and egg hair conditioner concoction in which I left on my hair for 30 minutes, I haven't yet used it alone for the several hours overnight, after I rinsed my hair I put rosemary oil and the pure mustard oil on my hair when it was wet, it came out very soft with a mayonnaise odor. The mustard oil has a light scent similar to grapeseed oil - many reviews I read online stated it has a bad smell on your hair, this oil doesn't have much of scent at all. This was my first time ever purchasing and using pure mustard oil and by this brand so I can't be much help judging the quality of this particular brand of pure mustard oil. I probably would look into going to an Indian grocery store first for this product before purchasing it again from this seller.

review/text: Upon receiving the KTC mustard oil, we noticed that the label said for external use only. As the product was listed with other "gourmet food items" we had assumed that this was a mustard flavored food oil. Not a mustard Seed oil. There is a big difference and one that could be dangerous if not noted. The Amazon ad did not relate any warnings or ingredient list that I could find, that would have helped me avoid purchasing the wrong item.

Can't beat the price per bottle (after subscription) anywhere else on the web or at the local grocery store. Totally satisfied customer here.

review/summary: HAIRBALL aid-Helps cats with getting enough fiber
review/text: My cat suffers from hairballs in the spring shedding season. I had read that squash and pumpkin baby food helps add fiber to the cats diet. She likes the spoonful I add to her food and it does seem to help with the dreaded hairballs. I know most people reading this will be concerned about human babies-but my furry kid is important to me.

review/summary: Got the subscription. My twins both like this one
review/text: When I first tried out the variety pack, this Winter Squash was one of the flavors that my twin babies instantly liked. I started getting subscriptions for some of the flavors one at a time. As they're getting bigger and eating more, I've added subscriptions. We've run out at times and were forced to buy at the store, and I'm now determined to just keep those subscriptions going and not run out again. I don't have a store nearby that beats the subscription price and with twins, I'm more than happy to get the packages delivered and have fewer errands. (As an aside, I'm personally beat and have learned even greater respect for parents in general. With twins, one gets humbled in short order. When I see how other parents manage, I'm always in awe at how good they are.) The jars arrive very well packaged and I've never had any problems personally. They come 12 in a box, the box is completely wrapped in lots bubble wrap so well that I need scissors to open the actual bubble wrap, and finally in a strong larger box.I have added this one knowing they like it and will readily eat it. My other 4 oz. subscriptions are: carrots, lentil and rice, chicken dinner and sweet potato. Soon I expect to add fruit flavors but the pediatrician advised to wait on fruit jars until they're just a little older and to start out with the vegetable ones. The chicken dinner, which is really chicken with brown rice, was also advised but it has more squash than chicken. When we ordered that, we crossed the threshold and departed from a vegetarian diet for our now 8+ month old babies. We are not vegetarians but consume very little meat and poultry, so I guess our babies follow our personal guidelines, although as an ideal we'd eventually be vegetarians. The only reason I didn't order the squash subscription earlier was that the chicken dinner has so much squash in it.What I've also discovered is that the features included in managing one's subscriptions (within My Account) are very good. You can tell them you're out and want the next one sooner and several other options as well. I've got several other subscriptions, such as baby formula and also some supplements for the adults in the household, and find the managing subscription feature very handy.Ingredients per label: Organic winter squash, water necessary for processing.This has 40 calories, 5% protein, 100% vitamin A, 20% vitamin C, 4% calcium and 2% iron. I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult.

review/summary: Great taste and good nutrition
review/text: I feed both my kids Earth's Best brand baby/toddler food when I am unable to prepare food myself. All flavors have a short list of ingredients, good flavor and a nice nutrition profile.I usually wrap these jars in a ziplock bag with a baby spoon and stash in the diaper bag for wholesome food on the go. I like to feed my toddler what my husband or I eat, but it is great having a back-up if she is really not hip to the entree.Earths Best is the next best thing to mom's cooking ;)Off label use:If you are out of oil when making baked goods, like pumpkin muffins, you can add a jar of complimentary flavored baby food in a pinch and they will still come out moist! Happy accidents are worth sharing!

review/summary: Ideal for Cat Toilet Training
review/text: If you're toilet training a cat and need a filler to keep the #2 soft and comfortable, this does very well. The cat tolerates it mixed in her food, it's safe for cats, and the results do just fine. A teaspoon or two in each wet meal and no constipation. Granted that's not what mothers are concerned about but this is the best of the baby foods for the purpose.

review/summary: Thick, good texture, fresh tasting, baby loves it.
review/text: This is my daughter's favorite baby food flavor and one of the two we will keep on subscription (spinach and potatoes is her other favorite). The flavor is bland (as is most baby food) but fresh. The texture is nice and thick so a big bite will stay on the spoon and not drip all over the place. This is nice for older babies (9+ months) because some of the pureed foods are too thin and basically liquid. Squash is a healthy, non-starchy, vegetable and I'm happy my daughter is developing a taste for it at a young age.

review/summary: Has A Wonderful Texture And Taste
review/text: I am actually someone who will buy baby food and eat it just to get some extra serving of vegetables. I put them in smoothies and to add flavor to soups as well. This one I tasted cold and it tasted like squash, nothing artificial and the texture was perfect. Very smooth and creamy which is one thing that I really love about it. Another thing I love is it being organic and GMO free. These are packed with nutrition perfect for growing babies. I did notice however though when I heated it up the taste changed which I found to be strange. Heated up it tasted like spaghettio's which was kind of a turn off to me. I dont know how the babies feel but I am sure they wont know the difference. I think that I will stick to buying cascadian farms frozen winter squash. That has a better taste when heated up. But for smoothies and soups, possibly even to put in bread to moisten I will be purchasing this from Earths Best.

review/summary: broken, moldy, and wet INSIDE the packaged shipping box.
review/text: I opened the mailed box which was completely in tact and normal. When I opened it, immediately a smell overcame the entire kitchen. I cut the plastic bubble wrap off of the box of squash and noticed it wet and MOLDY! One of the glass jars was broken and appeared to be for a while. There was mold and STINK everywhere. I called and thank goodness AMAZON offered to replace or refund it. Why would they send something like this for a BABY. My son was premature 30 weeks and has an allergy to protein along with reflux...I cannot imagine! It really made me horribly upset and why I am writing this review to ZERO...This is the first time I ever had a problem and a huge one it is to me. - AND I tried to give a ZERO star rating but I had to check a star to continue.

review/summary: Ooo, I hate to be a spoiler but......
review/text: ...these muffins are a big disappointment. See that lovely BROWNED muffin top on box picture? Welllll, I've tried several boxes of these, using different oven temperatures, making them plain, with fruit, with nuts, with everything I could think of except chocolate (hmmm, maybe I'll try that!) The tops stay a pale, pasty WHITE! Sooo unappetizing. And false advertising, IMHO.Now for the taste. Another disappointment. They are bland bland bland, blah, blah, blah! You MUST add additional ingredients or they are just plain, uh, RICEY tasting - and if you're an older celiac, you know what I mean. Those first corporate attempts at making GF mixes were hideous! These are no better. Yuck!Now for the size. I'm a pretty doggone accomplished baker if I do say so myself, both prior to my diagnosis in 1985 with non-GF ingredients, and since, using mixes and baking from scratch. These just don't RISE! See the photo with that lovely dome muffin shape? Nuh-uh. Perhaps they use old, REALLY old leavening? Dunno. But they puff up only about 1/16" of a centimeter. Maybe. But I doubt it.Now for the boxed ingredients. Cheesh, you have to add all of the EXPENSIVE stuff to make these work. Butter, milk, eggs, and fruit/nuts/whatever. Fer cryin' out loud, it's truly no more trouble, and a WHOLE lot cheaper to make muffins from scratch.I desperately wanted to love these and give a great review. But I just cannot. Make your own muffins and save your hard-earned money for some of the Gluten-free Pantry's other mixes - I rate the following 5 stars without hesitation:Country French Bread mix - absolutely delicious!! We use our bread machine and they come out PERFECT every time! And when we've used regular oven, in our french bread loaf pans, we add some toasted sesame seeds, and they are incredible.Chocolate Truffle Brownie Mix - OMG - completely addictive!! Gotta watch out for these if you're on a diet. You'll want to gobble up the whole batch!Beth's All Purpose Flour - quick & easy to use for all your baking (including those homemade muffins).Spice Cake and Gingerbread Mix - delicious - and sooooo easy - I can prepare it faster than it takes my oven to heat up. (Isn't that one of the BEST reason for buying a mix?) I add additional cinammon, nutmeg, ginger - we like it that way.Coffee Cake Mix - fantastic - and EASY - the crumble topping is included. Wonderful for a breakfast treat and NOT just for Celiacs.So that's about it. Try it - you may like it. Hey - that's what makes horse racing! But don't buy a whole case in the event that you don't.Regards to all you brave Celiacs out there. Let's hope that someday science can find a solution for us to make our lives a little easier. In the meantime, heaven bless these fabulous companies for providing us with these products.

review/summary: My son's favorite muffins!
review/text: These are my absolute favorite go-to GFCF muffins! At first I was put off by having to add the flavoring myself (having previously used Jiffy mixes), but now I like the ability to personalize the flavoring without having to stock dozens of different mixes. However, since my 9-y-o ASD son has texture issues, dried fruits are NOT an option for us (he just drops the fruit, or the rest of the muffin, when he comes to it), so I just measure 3/4 cup of all-fruit spread. Easy and versatile! I've also used fresh mashed banana and canned pumpkin. Even made it one time with just OJ instead of milk and no mix-ins (we were at my folks' and had already started mixing when we realized there was no GFCF milk); they were delicious that way, too!One tip I would like to share with everyone: Instead of mixing the whole package of dry ingredients and the whole cup of milk at once, mix like an old-fashioned cake recipe and alternate the dry & the milk. It makes the batter lighter and you get more muffins. (I average 22!)

review/summary: Best gluten-free baking mix out there
review/text: This is the best gluten-free baking mix out there. The scones are an every-weekend treat for me. Switch out different chopped nuts and dried fruits (orange-flavored dried cranberries make for an incredible scone) for unlimited variety. A box makes 12. I like to mix up the whole batch, make three (or four when I'm feeling extra piggy), and refridgerate the batter for later baking. I prefer to shape the unused dough into a thick log, so I can cut off a few scones and bake over the next few days. (I've never tried to extend it for longer than that.)This is one of those products that makes the wheatless life not bad at all.

review/summary: Fab mix for yummy GF scones & pancakes...
review/text: Please know that I've been GF for >10 years so my history is mostly making GF bakery items from scratch. That said, I was skeptical about this mix and bypassed it many times before giving it a try. Holy cows! am I gald I did try it. Yes, one must add a couple ingredients to complete the task - what's the problem with that? I like adding my own fresh ingredients and the idea that I can be as creative as I want with this 'box of scratch'.For me, I like using the mix for cranberry scones best of all. I prepare/bake the entire batch, eat what I want whilst warm and freeze the rest as they will dry out quickly. The scones that will be frozen I allow to cool and then wrap each one individually with foil and place in a ziplock bag. When I want a scone I just pull one out and remove the foil, wrap in a napkin and pop in the microwave for 20 or 30 seconds, or just allow to thaw in the foil to eat later.I have made beautiful chocolate chip muffins with the mix but prefer the scones much more. Although I never was a of lover pancakes or waffles (I guess because they made me sick) but I decided to try the pancake recipe on the box...who knew orange juice would be a good addition to a pancake recipe...I love the pancakes and make them often. This mix is very easy to work with and I'm happy getting it through the subscribe & save program because it is very economical and easy.

review/summary: So glad we found this
review/text: This is the best gluten free muffin mix I have been able to find. My whole family is impressed, even the ones who aren't GF. The mix also makes the best pancakes, gluten free mix or not. We were all very suprised, and I've already bumped up our subscription to get more.I read a review that said the muffins didn't rise and didn't look like what was on the box. I don't know if maybe they've changed the recipe since that was written, but our muffins have all turned out great, both the taste and the look.You do need to let them cool completely. If you just can't wait, you'll be scraping the muffin off of the cupcake liner. I've made banana nut and blueberry. The mix does say to add dried fruit, and I have used fresh or frozen fruit instead. I don't know if that made a difference. I haven't tried the scone recipe yet, but am looking forward to it.Of course, the cost is higher than mixes that are not gluten free, and you do have to add butter, eggs, vanilla, and milk, but I'm just thankful to have found something so good.

review/text: This mix makes nice chocolate chip muffins; they are a bit bland without the chocolate chips. I double the vanilla. For those customers with the browning issues: try lowering your oven rack, and baking a bit longer than recommended. With some experimentation, I now get nice golden brown muffins.These aren't super-easy for a mix - you need to add a fair number of ingredients. But they are tasty, and relatively simple to make. My kids like them a lot. They also freeze well.

review/text: I'm writing this, as much as anything, to point out what's on the back of the box. There are recipes for muffins, scones, AND pancakes on the back of the box.Also, as much as you might love Gluten-free Pantry Mixes, if you have celiac and you're lactose intolerant as well (50% of us are)--this is one of the only mixes that you can buy. (Avoid the bread mix or the quick mix--they have buttermilk and whey powder.)However, this doesn't have milk, buttermilk or whey in it, and you can even make pancakes with it. Nice job.

review/text: This is an absolute amazing price for this muffin and scone mix! I purchased it as an &#34;add-on&#34; item, and was expecting boxes like the small Jiffy boxes of regular muffin mix you would find in the store, but these are big boxes of GF muffin mix, and they came shipped in their own box! I was completely surprised at how low the price was of these with free 2 business day shipping with my prime - I don't know how Amazon makes any money on them at all. I have used them once for some blueberry muffins, and never got a chance to eat one myself, because my husband ate them all before I could try one! I'm assuming by this that they were delicious, but I'll have to wait until I make another batch before *I* can try one! Will definitely buy again at this price though, even if my husband turns out to be the only one who likes them! I will update this review once I've eaten one of these muffins!

review/text: I made these today for breakfast. OMG they were so good! I followed the directions on the package & used buttermilk.I added 1 cup fresh blueberries. To keep them from sinking I tossed them in 1/4 cup of the dry mix prior to adding. I mixed them in last. Also made a "crumbly topping" for them by mixing some GF Pantry flour, oats, chopped pecans, cinnamon & brown sugar. Cut in enough butter to have the topping hold together when squished into a ball.Add this topping to the top of the muffin batter.I used the extra large muffin tin and got 6 muffins. They browned nicely and had a nice crumb feel to them. Very easy to make.The muffins rose nicely and tasted divine. I will definitely keep this mix around.Can't wait to try the scone recipe.

review/text: I've never been a scone person, but when I found out I had an allergy to wheat, I was on the hunt to fulfill my need for bread products. I decided to try the Gluten-Free Pantry's Muffin & Scone mix, and I'm so glad I took the chance. Although overpriced, the scones have a fluffy and crunchy texture. I add cranberries and pecans. The box says it makes more than it really does. I get about 7-8 hand sized scones from the mix. They don't last long, however. Neighbors, family, friends scoop them up. They're buttery, and delicious, and great with jam. Enjoy!

Of course blueberries are great too. They are not gritty at all and are good even after a few days if kept in a sealed container or bag in the refrigerator. Just pop them in the micro for 20 seconds and they are great! They freeze very well too.

review/text: These are incredibly delicious. If you think that you can't have a Gluten Free muffin and have it taste delicious, you are wrong. The GF Pantry mix is great. Not only is it incredibly easy to make it bakes well and consistently. We have made the muffins plain and with add-ins (Blueberries, peanut butter) and every time they tasted great!This is a must for those on the Gluten Free Diet

review/summary: FANTASTIC!
review/text: This is truly a great versatile mix. Substituting oil for butter and rice milk for regular milk works out perfect. Using orange juice for the milk makes great pancakes and muffins as well. The options are endless for muffins- our favorite is adding a bit of cinnamon and GFCF chocolate chips. I also sneak in small amounts of light colored pureed veggies (baby food).

review/text: I really have no idea how this product has so many positive reviews. It tastes like cardboard. I've tried fruit, nuts, poppyseeds and even chocolate. Nothing makes these taste better. I've very thankful that I got these on the clearnace rack at the grocery store (although now I know why they were on clearance!)

review/summary: Brown lovely when you bake them just a little longer - Delicious!
review/text: We now have another gluten-free hit! We don't have to avoid gluten, but I'm trying to cut down on gluten for myself and my family. We're big fans of Gluten Free Pantry's cornbread mix (which I usually make as muffins,The Gluten-Free Pantry Yankee Cornbread Mix, 12-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)), and I just tried this muffin & scone mix.I have guests coming for the weekend, so the first time I used this mix, I made a double batch (2 boxes at once), for a total of 24 regular sized muffins. This mix is perfect for adding your own fruits or nuts. I added the recommended 3/4 cup per batch of fruit (dried cranberries) and a dash of lemon oil extract. Boy did these muffins turn out great!The directions say to "bake 16 minutes or until cake tester comes out clean". After 16 minutes, the muffins looked done, but they weren't browned on the top at all. I put them in another 3 minutes, tested one (by eating it) at its new slightly-browned-top stage (yum); then put the rest in for another 2 minutes for a nicely mostly-browned top. After the extra 5 minutes of cooking, the muffins are not dried out or overdone. They are delicious. Everybody's oven is different, but if you try this mix and they aren't browned after the recommended baking time, you may be able, like me, to leave them in longer without any negative effect on taste or texture.We have a diabetic in the house, so counting carbs is important. If you make 12 muffins from one box of mix, and use whole milk, one muffin has 30.9 carbs.The box also has directions for making scones and pancakes from this mix.So far I've tried two Gluten Free Pantry products, and I am very happy with both of them.

review/summary: my new favorite muffin mix
review/text: I love this product. I always substitute applesauce for the melted butter, initially because I didnt have 6Tbs of butter on hand, from then on because it worked fine and seemed a bit healthier. I also always add a generous sprinkling of flax meal in the mix (half cup or so?). My muffins always come out with nice rounded, golden brown tops and a decent texture. I have found that I do have to cook them longer than the recommended time (usually around 25 min). I have made many delicious variations- apple with butterscotch chips, chocolate chip with orange and cinnamon, blueberry with lemon peel, apricot with almonds. This mix provides a quick and easy base for all these variations. I will definitely buy it again and recommend it to anyone, gluten free or not.

review/text: Ours DO brown on top but not always and come out a decent size. They're not rice-y in my opinion and even my 3yo who isn't allergic to gluten/wheat loves them. He's a very picky eater. I fold in Ghiradelli dark chocolate chips when I make muffins with this mix and they're always a hit.

review/text: I made these for the first time as scones and they turned out wonderfully! I think the secret is what you add-- I did follow the recipe, but I can't have eggs, so I used ground flax as a substitute (1 T ground flax soaked in 3 T water per egg). Then I added cinnamon, lemon zest, a tsp of lemon juice, dried blueberries and walnuts, then sprinkled the tops with sugar. YUM!!!! I can't even tell that they are gluten free! They were fantastic right out of the oven, still great the next morning... and they were good re-heated as well. Definitely getting these again. It would be good try these additions with the muffin recipe as well!

Also added some fresh sweet corn, GF corn meal and sugar to make out-of-this-world corn muffins. This mix is different because it doesn't have a gritty texture like some GF mixes -- it is as close to regular, flour-made stuff as you can get. I love experimenting with this mix and my family -- GF members and non-GF members -- all think it's great!

review/summary: Best GF muffin mix!
review/text: I've used this mix to make blueberry muffins and cinnamon rolls. My VERY picky daughter loved them! Better than the homemade recipes I've found. They do not brown up very well. If you leave them in the oven until they brown they will be overdone. Many GF items don't brown well so it's not a product problem...it's just due to the types of flour used. They still taste great. Thanks!!!!

I use orange juice, I think that's what the recipe on the package calls for, and love the taste. My mom uses the product for scones. I make my gluten-free muffins from scratch (I use a recipe in Carol Fenster's 1,000 Gluten-Free Recipes, which I've reviewed) so I haven't tried this for those. But I like to keep it on hand for pancakes and have taken it camping for pancakes.

I did not use the orange juice it calls for, but used milk instead, and they turned out great. The waffles I made were light and crispy. They freeze well, too. For another treat, I pop the frozen waffles in the toaster until hot, then serve them with butter and jelly like toast. Gluten-free dieters need all the variety they can find!

review/summary: Makes Super Gluten-Free Scones
review/text: Made a batch of scones from this mix just this morning. Had to improvise because I didn't have any buttermilk. Used Greek yogurt instead, in the same amount, but added a tablespoon of orange juice to thin it. Before baking, I added a little more OJ to the leftover yogurt to spread on the tops, then sprinkled each with a tiny bit of organic sugar. I also made them larger than recommended and got eight nice sized scones. Like all scones, they were just a bit crumbly, but these were not dry like many scones I've had.They were a hit with my family, so I'll definitely be making them again. And I'll try adding other ingredients. Orange zest and sliced almonds, or blueberries, or shredded sharp cheddar, or crumbled feta cheese and chopped olives...

review/summary: As close to the real thing as you'll get going gluten-free
review/text: This is a fantastic mix. Many of the GF Pantry mixes are excellent, and this one is in my top five, along with their Brown Rice Pancake and Waffle Mix. During the summer when it's too hot to bake, I make these 3-at-a-time in my toaster oven and they come out just as good as if I used the large oven. These are the best tasting scones I've ever made that are gluten-free. They are very, very close to the real British scones you'll get at the tea shop or in your local bakery. Unlike other gf mixes, I find that these have staying power beyond the first 24 hours. If you refrigerate in an air tight container, just pop them into the toaster oven for a quick warm up before serving and they are just as good as when you baked them. I buy them by the case now and have never been disappointed. I also like to add a tsp. of lemon or almond oil purchased from King Arthur Flour baking company. If you are a scone fan and have been diagnosed with celiac or with a grain intolerance, feel deprived no more! This is well worth the purchase. Happy Baking!

While you do not need to be on a low carb diet to enjoy these, the fact that they are low in carbs is a windfall for some.

review/summary: very dense finished product
review/text: I have purchased this item 3 times and have had positive results each time. Though the finished product is very dense and not as sweet as the traditional Jiffy Corn Muffin, if you have gluten intolerance, you will find this to be an adequate replacement. It does offer lactose free directions (a common condition for those recently diagnosed with celiac)which is my usual prep method. The only drawback of the lactose free version is the oil tends to separate from the batter as it bakes, but does not effect the overall quality of the finished product. Leftovers should be refrigerated, and reheated in the microwave for best taste.

I don't like most gluten free products (I just smile and eat) but this one is really good. The mix has good flavor and texture, is simple to make, and makes dad a hero on "chili" night. Much better than the Bob's Red Mill. Only knocked one star off because I hate paying the higher price for gluten-free stuff.

review/summary: You must try these muffins!
review/text: These are a staple - I always have some made and keep them in the freezer. If you add an extra egg they are more fluffy. If you leave out the sugar, they make a great substitute for english muffins in eggs benedict. I am very sorry amazon quit carrying these - I go through the 6 pack in 6 to 8 weeks.

review/summary: Gluten-free cornbread mix
review/text: This cornbread mix is so good, I serve it to the whole family and they have no idea it is gluten-free. It actually tastes better than the grocery shelf cornbread mixes I had made and eaten before my diagnosis of celiac disease.The cost is compatible with most standard mixes. I make muffins with the mix and they store well in the refrigerator and can be warmed up for another day without losing its texture or flavor.

review/summary: BEST Cornbread I've ever eaten...PERIOD!
review/text: We are eating gluten free by choice. We don't like cornbread as a rule, because cornbread made without some flour is just yucky. I bought this mix at the grocery store on a fluke. We needed it for a meal. OMG!!!! IT WAS AMAZING!!!! I've made it using sweet milk and buttermilk. No matter what milk we use it is amazing! Even my picky granddaughter wants it all the time. Well worth the money.It reaheats well too. We have kept it in the refrigerator, wrapped for up to 10 days. After day 9, it started drying out, but still tasted good. We microwaved it with a wet papertowel covering the piece and it was good.I've made it by standard recipe, as well as jalepeno. Yummy. Chop some fresh jalepeno's, a small tomato, and a bit of onion. Use 1/4 cup LESS of the milk and add a small (the teeny 'individual') can of creamed corn. yummy!

review/summary: Best gluten-free cornbread!
review/text: When I was diagnosed with Celiac's Disease I new I could not go without my sweet cornbread. Finally, I found this, Gluten-Free Pantry Yankee Cornbread. The only change I make to the directions on the box is I add a 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 1/4 cup. It makes alot so I just freeze the cornbread and take it out when I need it.

review/summary: Great Taste! 25.3 grams of carbs per muffin
review/text: I've tried a from-scratch gluten-free cornbread recipe before, and it was too close to cornmeal mush for us to consider it cornbread. I ordered this cornbread mix from The Gluten-Free Pantry on a whim, and the whole family is delighted with it. It tastes great and has the consistency of "real" cornbread.I mentioned the carb count because my son was recently diagnosed with Type I Diabetes. Until we get more used to estimating carbs in home-made foods, a mix helps us be more exact about carbs per portion. One box of this Yankee Cornbread Mix makes 12 medium-size muffins of 25.3 grams of carbs, each.We do not have to eat gluten-free, but I've always found that a gluten free muffin always makes me feel less full, less like the muffin has congealed into a ball in my stomach. So we go gluten-free at times.You add sugar, milk, egg and melted butter to the mix. It calls for buttermilk, but I make it with whole milk and it still tastes great. Ingredients in the mix are corn meal, white rice flour, baking powder (corn), and salt. The label states it also contains soy, but I can't find any ingredient with soy (such as soy lecithin) on the box's labeling. It could be that it is manufactured with machines that also process soy products, so, just to be safe, they mention the soy.This is an excellent product and I highly recommend it. But it is expensive, considering that you have to add most of the recipe to the mix. You are paying for the convenience of not having to sift your own corn meal and rice flower.

review/text: My daughter has celiac and we have tried every g-free cornbread mix out there. Being very southern, I only put a small amount of the sugar in my cornbread, we don't like it too sweet down here! I added 1/2 cup diced jalapenos, 1/2 cup yellow sweet corn, and 1/2 cup sharp cheddar cheese and it was fabulous! We eat it with our taco soup and chili all winter long.

review/text: Corn bread is one staple I have missed since becoming gluten free. I used to use a cheap little box, as my mom did. This mix comes very close in flavor and texture and works wonderfully. It is pricey, but not insanely so. Makes good Southern corn bread or, with additional sweetener of your choice, a good New England cake type. I don't feel deprived anymore.

review/text: This cornbread was very tasty, considering all of the modifications that I had to make to accomodate my son's food allergies (Wheat, Diary and Eggs). I made by own buttermilk by adding cider vinegar to unsweetend almond milk. I used Earth Balance's Olive Oil butter in place of the butter required. Lastly, I used Ener-G's egg replacer for the egg required. It wasn't as sweet as I would have liked so the next time I make it I will increase the sugar. It also was a tad dry. Notwithstanding, it still tasted very good. I will definately buy it again.

I keep a box in the truck and one at work. The previous reviewer finds them dry. If I'm eating I'm generally having something to drink with it and therefore dry does not bother me. If you find them dry try some of their other products. Thanks Amazon for a great selection of gluten free foods.

review/summary: Bitter tasting for a reason: ~1400mg potassium / 30g
review/text: Treacle one of the highest sources of dietary potassium available. 30 grams of this is equivalent to two full potatoes, three or more bananas, 12-16 oz of fish. If you like this and want to easily boost your potassium (and possibly lower your blood pressure and risk of other diseases) this can be one easy way to do so.

review/summary: I've always wanted to try Treacle
review/text: After discovering Lyle's Golden Syrup, which I love, I realized Lyle's also makes Treacle. I've always wanted to try Treacle so when I saw this available on Amazon I added it to one of my orders. It tastes very much &#34;black liquorice&#34; whips (which I like). I'm not really sure how I will use it yet though. I love to cook so I'm sure I'll find something to do with it. Looks like I'll have to search for a recipe or two.

review/text: i love this tin, love the lion. Around our house I call him Lyle and my wife insists he looks more like a Tate. I've got one in the garage in which I keep all my loose screws, change etc, another in the kitchen which stores all our pens, pencils and whatnot, and a third in the bathroom in which I keep my false teeth, condoms, dental floss, and various ass creams. Looking at this tin makes me feels accomplished somehow, so why not eh? I don't know what a treacle is or where I might find use one, but when I do that'll just be icing on the cake. What gorgeous use of red, black and gold. I may never be king of the forrest, but thanks Tate & Lyle for making me feel like a lion nonetheless. a ROARING FIVE STARS!!!!!

review/text: As the reviewer stated before, the orange is quite acidic and the carrot juice is not noticeable. Hopefully the benefits of the carrots will still be felt in my body though.I purchased the orange and carrot as the Lakewood brand's Carrot juice has lemon juice in it which is not truly carrots only. Carrots by themselves are excellent in a juice form I don't know why they can't stick to the basics or come up with a better flavor to mix than orange or lemon.

review/text: I bought this thinking that it would taste delicious, at Whole Foods.. It was $4.49 which is small for the size, also leading me to believe that I would taste delicious organic carrots and orange. It just tasted really watered down, and just ... not good! I barely tasted any carrots and I did taste orange but very acidic. I love sour fruits but this was just not good. The color of the bottle fooled me. Don't buy this item, save your money. Wish I went for Odwalla. Oh well lesson to be learned.

review/summary: Graham crackers good enough for Mommy to eat too!
review/text: I LOVE these graham sticks. They dissolve well and are super yummy (yes, I have eaten quite a few of them:). I think they taste better than any other graham cracker I've tried, and they're organic to boot. As far as sugary snacks go, they have pretty healthy ingredients. I like pretty much everything I've tried from Earth's best. For those of you interested in how they're sweetened they contain organic invert syrup, organic evaporated can juice, and organic honey. They don't have anything "scary" in them like maltodextrin or other such sweeteners. Just vitamins and natural, organic products.

review/summary: Taste and smell were intolerable.
review/text: I bought these graham sticks based on their excellent reviews and having purchased Earth's Best organic vanilla cookies, had high hopes for a healthy snack to serve my kids. Needless to say, I should have purchased one box at the grocery store first before committing to 6 boxes through Amazon (which you are unable to return -even unopened boxes- since this is a food item). The crackers smelled strange even before tasting them. My 5 year old turned up her nose and refused to eat them anymore after trying a few. I wish I could describe the taste, but it would be really hard. It may sound strange for an organic food, but it was almost like a faint chemical smell. At best, I can say that they weren't anything like a regular graham cracker flavor (even as an organic option they should have a better taste). My 2 year old did eat some of them without complaint, so I am hoping she will tolerate them through 6 boxes so I feel like I did not waste my money. Good price, but definitely test one box first to see if you like them.

review/summary: L&M is quite a bit better
review/text: If you have never had pure cranberry juice, then you might find the Lakewood exceptional. However, it is not nearly as good as L&M. Compared to L&M, the Lakewood tastes sort of watery and flavorless, as if Lakewood used a lower quality of cranberry in making their juice. The L&M is alot crisper and full of good cranberry flavor. The L&M color is also nice and bright red, whereas the Lakewood is considerably more brown. As far as I know, they are about the same price.

review/summary: The Best Grapefruit Juice I Ever Tasted
review/text: Lakewood Organic Pink Grapefruit Juice surpasses even fresh squeezed in balance and quality. It's perfectly balanced without a hint bitterness or unripe "green" taste. It does not disappoint. There was no separation or sediment in the bottle. The pulp was very fine and almost indiscernible in my mouth. This is really a "must try" product.By the way, my package arrived in 2 days even though it wasn't supposed to ship for a week. Also, those 6 bottles came in the best designed packing material I've ever received in an Amazon order - no peanuts and rolled newspaper here! This shipment will be gone in the blink of an eye so I plan to order more soon.

review/summary: Sweetest Grapefruit Juice Ever!
review/text: I don't know what happened to my first review. But I've noticed reviews I've written have disappeared. Why? When they are usually raving reviews?The Lakewood Pure Organic Juices are ALL great. I have noticed some are not always available, and don't know when or if they will return. I can't lug juices from stores to car - car to house, etc. so I have been thankful to Amazon for carrying many of them in the past. The Grapefruit Juice is exceptional. I hope the Orange-Mango returns, and the Blueberry and Pomegranate. They are sometimes available at Whole Foods Market, but not always. PS: If you have to take statin drugs for high cholesterol, grapefruit juice can interfere. Ask your doctor. I can drink this juice now and am grateful to find it here at Amazon!

review/summary: Perfection
review/text: This box is amazing. It contains all 50 flavors and each in its own compartment. To make it even more perfect, there is a clear plastic insert that keeps all the jelly beans in their separate compartments and keeps them from getting mixed up when the box is possibly tossed around during shipping. Not one bean snuck out of its spot. The flavors are both fascinating and creative and really do taste like what they are supposed to with only a couple exceptions. They were fun to play with and we took turns blindfolding each other to taste the flavors and see how well we could guess what we just tried. Some were hard and many were challenging but a few were easy and quick. It was a fun game and it really was harder than it sounds. It also made us realize how much taste depends on sight.On the inside of the lid is a picture that shows the jelly beans in their compartments with their name underneath, which really does help tremendously. The box also gives you ideas for flavor combinations to try, as does the Jelly Belly website, such as blueberry + blueberry + buttered popcorn = blueberry muffin. Those were fun to try out.This is a great gift and the jelly beans were fresh and flavorful. If you love jelly beans, you can't go wrong here.

review/summary: The best potato chips I've ever had
review/text: Being a typical American consumer, I've eaten a lot of various types of potato chips. Of all of them, these are the best ones I've ever had. They are just the perfect blend of crunchy and salty. They also go great with dips and spreads. I've had them with vegetable dip, french onion dip, ranch, guacamole, and port wine cheese spread- ALL DELICIOUS. They are also not as bad for you as other potato chips as all they contain are potatoes, vegetable oil, and salt- no preservatives. I recommend this item for both the occasional snacker and the seasoned potato chip lover.I was originally going to give this item 4 stars because we had a problem with our first shipment. However, Amazon customer service resolved it and our replacements were in perfect order.

The smell of this wonderful product woke me with a stirring in my belly and I went right to my cupboard to make myself a delicious treat. How did I want to indulge myself this time. A little Bitter Gourd Pickle with Garlic on crackers? A peanut butter and Bitter Gourd Pickle with Garlic sandwich? Maybe some great coffee ice cream topped with Bitter Gourd Pickle with Garlic? Oh, my mind was alight with creative juices. But in the end, I decided to be a purist and ate it right out of the jar! Yum! While I like the product a lot, though, I feel it could be improved a bit with a few chopped walnuts to add texture. Hence, the 3-star rating.

review/summary: Midnight Cravings
review/text: Ok, I admit to midnight cravings - you know what I mean. You are lying on the couch reading a book and all of a sudden you have that sudden urge: gotta have some bitter gourd pickles NOW. This drives my husband crazy - he's getting tired of throwing on his clothes to make a trip to the all night convenience store just to buy me jars of gourd pickles. Good thing I found them here on Amazon!Everyone knows how tasty gourds are, and the fact that these are bitter makes them that much better. And the GARLIC really seals the deal - you can smell them in my perspiration for days! What a delicious reminder of those delightful gourd pickles.Only drawback - I can't give these 5 stars until they start packaging them in plastic jars. The mailman dropped my last shipment (literally)at my doorstep and now even the dog won't use this door!
